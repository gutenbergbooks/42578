<h2>INTRODUCTION BY THE EARL OF
SHEFFIELD.</h2>


<p>The centenary of the death of Edward Gibbon (died January,
1794, aged fifty-six) was recorded by a public commemoration
held in London in November, 1894, at the instance of the Royal
Historical Society. The distinguished committee of English
and foreign students, who were associated on that occasion,
invited me to become their President, as representing the family
with which Gibbon had been so intimately connected, and which
still retained the portraits, manuscripts, letters, and relics of the
historian. The exhibition of these in the British Museum, and
the commemoration held on November 15, reawakened interest
in the work and remains of one of the greatest names in English
literature; and a general desire was expressed that the manuscripts
should be again collated, and that what was yet unpublished
might be given to the world.</p>

<p>As is well known, it was my grandfather, the first Earl, who
made the historian almost his adopted brother, gave him a home
both in town and in country, was his devisee and literary
executor, and edited and published the famous Autobiography,
the letters, and remains. All of these passed under Edward
Gibbon's will to Lord Sheffield; and, together with books, relics,
portraits, and various mementos, they have been for a century
preserved by my father and myself with religions care and veneration
in Sheffield Park. The original autograph manuscripts of
the <em>Memoirs</em>, the <em>Diaries</em>, <em>Letters</em>, <em>Note-books</em>, etc., have now
become the property of the British Museum, subject to the copyright
of all the unpublished parts which was previously assigned
to Mr. Murray. And it is with no little pleasure and pride that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
I have acceded to the request of the publishers that I would
introduce these unpublished remains to the world, and thus
complete the task of editing the historian, to which my grandfather
devoted so great a portion of his time, not only as a
testamentary duty, but as a labour of love.</p>

<p>The connection of the historian with my grandfather, his
early friend, John Holroyd, and the members of the Holroyd
family, forms one of the pleasantest and also most interesting
passages in literary history. It was in no way interrupted by
Lord Sheffield's public and official duties; it was continued
without a cloud to obscure their intimacy, until it was sundered
by death; and the Earl, who survived his friend so long, continued
to edit and to publish the manuscripts left in his hands
for some twenty years after the death of the historian.</p>

<p>By a clause in the will of Edward Gibbon, dated July 14,
1788, his papers were entrusted to Lord Sheffield and Mr. John
Batt, his executors, in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will that all my Manuscript papers found at the time of
my decease be delivered to my executors, and that if any shall
appear sufficiently finished for the public eye, they do treat for
the purchase of the same with a Bookseller, giving the preference
to Mr. Andrew Strahan and Mr. Thomas Cadell, whose liberal
spirit I have experienced in similar transactions. And whatsoever
monies may accrue from such sale and publication I give
to my much-valued friend William Hayley, Esq., of Eastham,
in the County of Sussex. But in case he shall dye before me,
I give the aforesaid monies to the Royal Society of London and
the Royal Academy of Inscriptions of Paris, share and share alike,
in trust to be by them employed in such a manner as they shall
deem most beneficial to the cause of Learning."</p>

<p>In pursuance of the directions contained in the will and of
many verbal communications, Lord Sheffield, in 1799, published
the <cite>Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon, with Memoirs of his
Life and Writings</cite>, in 2 vols., 4to. A third volume was added
in 1815, and a new edition of the whole, with additions, appeared
during the same year in 5 vols., 8vo. In 1837 another edition,
in one large 8vo volume, was published.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>By a clause in his own will, Lord Sheffield directed that no
further publication of the historian's manuscripts should be
made.</p>

<p>"And I request of my said trustees and my heirs that none
of the said manuscripts, papers, or books of the said Edward
Gibbon be published unless my approbation of the publication
be directed by some memorandum indorsed and written or signed
by me. And I also request the person entitled for the time
being to the possession thereof not to suffer the same to be
out of his possession or to be improperly exposed."</p>

<p>This direction has been strictly followed by my father, the
second Earl, and by myself; and it is believed that no person
has ever had access to any of the manuscripts for any literary
purpose, excepting the late Dean Milman, who, when editing
his well-known edition of the <cite>Decline and Fall</cite>, in 1842, was
permitted to inspect the original manuscripts of the Autobiography,
on condition of not publishing any new matter.</p>

<p>The commemoration of 1894, however, again raised the
question whether such an embargo on giving to the world
writings of national importance was ever meant to be, or even
ought to be, regarded as perpetual. Whilst persons named in
these papers or their children were living, whilst the bitter
controversies of the last century were still unforgotten, whilst
the fame of Edward Gibbon had hardly yet become one of our
national glories, it was a matter of good feeling and sound
judgment in Lord Sheffield to exercise an editor's discretion in
publishing his friend's confession and private thoughts. Now
that more than a hundred years have passed since his death,
no such considerations have weight or meaning. And the
opinion of those whom I have consulted, both professionally
and as private friends, amply corroborates my own conclusion,
that it is a duty which I owe to my own ancestor and to the
public to give to the world all the remains of the historian
which for more than a century have been preserved in the
strong room of Sheffield Park.</p>

<p>The unlocking of the cases in which these manuscripts were
secured was quite a revelation of literary workmanship, and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
led to a most interesting problem in literary history. The manuscripts
of the historian are all holographs&mdash;the text of the famous
Memoirs being written with extraordinary beauty of calligraphy,
and studied with the utmost care. But, singularly enough, none
of the texts are prepared for immediate, or even direct, publication.
The historian wrote, at various intervals between 1788 and 1793,
no less than <em>six</em> different sketches. They are not quite continuous;
they partly recount the same incidents in different form; they
are written in different tones: and yet no one of them is
complete; none of them seem plainly designed to supersede
the rest. There is even a small seventh sketch, from which one
of the noblest and most famous passages that Gibbon ever wrote
has been excised, and inserted in the published Autobiography.</p>

<p>Lord Sheffield executed his editorial task with extreme
judgment, singular ingenuity, but remarkable freedom. He was
assisted in preparing the manuscripts for publication by his wife
and by Lady Maria Holroyd, his eldest daughter, who became by
marriage the first Lady Stanley of Alderley. This very able and
remarkable woman, of whose abilities the historian expressed in
letters his great admiration, evidently marked the manuscripts
in pencil handwriting (now recognized as hers) for the printer's
copyist. These pencil deletions, transpositions, and even additions,
correspond with the Autobiography as published by Lord Sheffield.
Quite a third of the whole manuscript is omitted, and many of
the most piquant passages that Gibbon ever wrote were suppressed
by the caution or the delicacy of his editor and his family.</p>

<p>The result is a problem of singular literary interest. A piece,
most elaborately composed by one of the greatest writers who
ever used our language, an autobiography often pronounced to be
the best we possess, is now proved to be in no sense the simple
work of that illustrious pen, but to have been dexterously pieced
together out of seven fragmentary sketches and adapted into
a single and coherent narrative. The manner and the extent of
this extraordinary piece of editing has been so fully explained
in the address of November 15, published by the Centenary
Committee, that it is not necessary for me to enlarge upon it
further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had the discovery of the process by which Gibbon's
<cite>Autobiography</cite> had been concocted been made public, than a
general desire was expressed to have the originals published in
the form in which the historian left them. It was no case of
incomplete or illegible manuscripts, nor of rough drafts designed
only as notes for subsequent composition. The whole of the
seven manuscripts are written with perfect precision; the style
is in Gibbon's most elaborate manner; and each piece is perfectly
ready for the printer&mdash;so far as it goes. It was impossible to do
again the task of consolidation so admirably performed by Lord
Sheffield. Nothing remained but to print the whole of the pieces
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbatim</i>, as the historian wrote them, not necessarily in the order
of time of their apparent composition, but so as to form a
consecutive narrative of the author's life.</p>

<p>The reader may now rest assured that, <em>for the first time</em>, he has
before him the Autobiographic Sketches of Edward Gibbon in
the exact form in which he left them at his death. The portions
enclosed in dark brackets are the passages which were omitted by
Lord Sheffield, and in the notes are inserted the passages or
sentences, few and simple in themselves, which Lord Sheffield
added to the original manuscript. For various reasons it was
found impracticable to print the six sketches in parallel columns;
but the admirers of the historian and all students of English
literature will find abundant opportunity for collating the original
texts with each other, and with the text as published by the
editor, and now for a century current as one of the masterpieces
of English literature.</p>

<p>The <cite>Letters</cite> of the historian, the bulk of which were addressed
to Lord Sheffield and his family, were published in part by my
grandfather in one or other of the editions of <cite>The Miscellaneous
Works of Edward Gibbon</cite>. But in this collection many letters
were omitted, and most of them were printed with some omissions
and variations. These omissions have now been restored; and
the <cite>Letters</cite>, like the other papers of our author, are now for the
first time given to the world in the form in which they were
composed.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend to any rivalry with my grandfather in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
matter of the skill with which he performed the task of editing
and selecting for publication the remains of his friend. But
I can assure the reader that <em>every piece contained in this volume as
the work of Edward Gibbon is now printed exactly as he wrote it
without suppression or emendation</em>. And in transferring these
literary treasures to the nation, and in giving them to the world,
I feel that I am fulfilling the trust which the historian reposed
in my grandfather, and am acting in the spirit of the lifelong
friendship that bound him to my family.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude these prefatory remarks without acknowledging
to the fullest extent the obligation I am under to Mr. Frederic
Harrison for the assistance he has given me in the preparation
and composition of this Preface.</p>

<h2>EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This collection of Gibbon's correspondence, extending as it does
from 1753 to 1794, practically covers the whole of the historian's
life, and contains his observations on society, literature, and
politics during a period which includes such momentous events
as the Seven Years' War, the War of American Independence,
and the French Revolution.</p>

<p>By far the greater number of the letters now appear for the
first time; but portions of the correspondence, marked in this
edition with asterisks, were printed by Lord Sheffield shortly
after Gibbon's death. These published portions were treated
by the editor with great tact and more freedom. Lord Sheffield
was giving to the world letters which discussed recent events
and criticised living persons; it was, therefore, necessary for him
to suppress some allusions and conceal many names. Jealous
of his friend's literary reputation, he corrects errors in spelling
or grammar, gives a dignified turn to the more homely phrases,
and omits as trivial the petty details of domestic life. Sometimes,
also, Lord Sheffield's editorial methods pass beyond the
exercise of these more or less legitimate powers. In order to
concentrate the interest of the correspondence, he culls a few
lines from one letter, chooses a sentence from a second, extracts
a passage from a third, and prints his patchwork as a genuine
letter from Gibbon's own hand.</p>

<p>In this edition the letters are printed as they were written.
For the blanks which conceal the identity of persons are substituted
the real names; the suppressed passages are restored;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
the spelling and grammar of the original are preserved; the
language is left as Gibbon wrote it. If the Memoirs give us
Gibbon in the full dress of a fine gentleman of letters, the
correspondence reveals to us the man as he was known to his
valet and his housekeeper.</p>

<p>The letters have the ease and freshness of conversations with
intimate friends, and, considering the character of the century
in which they were written, they present one feature which
deserves special notice. Only one short sentence has been omitted
as too coarse to be printed. With this solitary exception, the
reader knows the worst as well as the best of Gibbon, and there
are scarcely a dozen phrases, scattered over 800 pages, which
will offend good taste or good feeling.</p>

<p>The notes must speak for themselves. Though some points
on which information is needed remain obscure, it is hoped that,
so far as they go, they may be found useful. In their correction
and revision, valuable aid has been given by Mr. G. H. Holden,
Assistant Librarian at All Souls' College, Oxford.</p>

<h2>GIBBON'S CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

<h3>1753-1794.</h3>


<p>On June 8, 1753, Edward Gibbon, then sixteen years of age,
and an undergraduate of Magdalen College, Oxford, was received
into the Roman Catholic Church by a Jesuit named Baker, one
of the chaplains to the Sardinian Embassy. His change of
religion led to his removal from the University, and decided his
father to place him under the care of M. Pavillard, a Calvinist
minister at Lausanne. Escorted by M. Frey, a Swiss gentleman
of Basle, Gibbon left England on June 19, 1753. His first
letter announces his safe arrival.</p>

<h3><em>To his Father.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
[Lausanne], July 30th, 1753.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>I must beg you to excuse my not having wrote till now,
but knowing that Mr. Frey had given you an account of my safe
arrival by the first post, I chose to stay some time, that I might
be able to give you a more exact account of my present situation.
After a pretty tiresome journey of eleven days, I got safe
to Lausanne. Mr. Frey, when he had delivered me into Mr.
Pavilliard's hands, left the place and went to Geneva. I have now
been with him a month, and during the whole time have been
treated by him with the greatest civility imaginable. I read
French twice every day with him. I already understand almost
all that is said, and can ask for any common things I want.
With regard to other things, the people here are extremely civil to
strangers, and endeavour to make this town as agreeable as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
possible. The English here are Mr. Townshend, nephew to the
present Lord Townshend, Lord Huntingtower, Mr. Crofts, and
Mr. Umberstone. I have also been introduced to the Earl of
Blessington, who resides here now with his family, as well as
to Madame de Brissoné, to whom you gave me a letter of recommendation,
and who is an extremely agreeable woman. This is
the chief I have to say of the place. As to the climate, I have
reason to think it will agree extremely well with me. When I
was at Calais my books were seized and sent to Paris to be
examined, but a friend there, whom Mr. Frey has wrote to, is to
send them to Lausanne. I must beg my sincere compliments to
Miss Ellison.</p>

<p class="signature">
I am, dear Sir,<br />
With the greatest respect and sincerity,<br />
Your most obedient and most dutiful son,<br />
<span class="smcap">Edward Gibbon</span>.

<h3><em>To his Aunt, Miss Catherine Porten.</em><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>


<p class="head">
February, 1755.
</p>

<p>"Pray remember this letter was not addressed to his mother-in-law,
but his aunt, an old cat as she was to refuse his request."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>*I have at length good news to tell you; I am now a
good Protestant, and am extremely glad of it.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I have in all
my letters taken notice of the different movements of my mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Entirely Catholic when I came to Lausanne, wavering long time
between the two systems, and at last fixed for the Protestant,
when that conflict was over, I had still another difficulty.
Brought up with all the ideas of the Church of England, I could
scarce resolve to communion with Presbyterians, as all the people
of this country are. I at last got over it in considering that, whatever
difference there may be between their churches and ours in
the government and discipline, they still regard us as brethren,
and profess the same faith as us. Determined, then, in my design,
I declared it to the ministers of the town assembled at Mr.
Pavilliard's, who, having examined me, approved of it, and permitted
me to receive the communion with them, which I did
Christmas Day, from the hands of Mr. Pavilliard, who appeared
extremely glad of it. I am so extremely myself, and do assure
you feel a joy pure, and the more so as I know it to be not only
innocent but laudable.*</p>

<p>Could I leave off here I should be very glad, but I have
another piece of news to acquaint you with. Mr. Pavilliard has
already hinted it in the letter you have, I suppose, already
received, and which I have translated into English. Let me tell
you the whole fact as it is really past.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GAMBLING SCRAPE.</div>

<p>One evening I went to see Mr. Gee, one of the English now
here. I found him in his room, playing at Pharaon with some
other gentlemen. I would have retired, but he desiring me to
stay, I took a chair and sat down by the fire. I continued to look
at the gamesters about half an hour, till one of them going away,
Gee desired me to take his place, and I refused; but on his
assuring me that I might punt as low as I would, at last complied,
and soon lost about half a guinea; this vexed me, and I continued
upon my word. The play warmed, and about three o'clock the
next morning I found I had lost only forty guineas. Guess my
situation (which I did not dare communicate to any one); such
a loss, and an utter impossibility of paying it. I took the worst
party I could. I demanded my revenge; they gave it me, and the
second meeting was still worse than the first. It cost me 1760
francs, or 110 guineas.</p>

<p>Never have I felt a despair equal to that I had then. I was
a great while hesitating upon the most violent parties. At last I
resolved to go seek my money in England, not doubting to be able
to raise that sum at London. I had not forgot that step would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
expose me to all the indignation of my father, but I shut my
eyes on all those considerations, to reflect that it was my only
resource to pay my debt and to disengage my word; in pursuance
of this, I bought a horse, a watch, and some other things of Mr.
Gee himself, payable with the rest in England, and set out proposing
to sell those things to carry me on my journey. Was
successful as far as Geneva, but there the difficulty I found to
dispose of my horse having stopped me some days, Pavilliard,
who had perceived my evasion, ran after me, and half entreaties,
half force, brought me back to Lausanne with him.</p>

<p>I am there at present, not knowing what to do; the term
given me almost out, and my creditors extremely pressing. What
party can I take? Should I acquaint my father with it? What
first-fruits of a conversion should I give him? I have then no
other resource than you. Tell me not you are poor, that you have
not enough for yourself. I do not address myself to you as the
richest, but as the kindest of my relations; nor do I ask it you as
a gift, but as a loan. If you could not furnish me the whole sum,
let me have at least a part of it. I know you have thoughts of
doing something for me by your will; I beg you only to anticipate
it. I shall make no use of any other prayers than this plain recite
of my situation; if it produces no effect on you, nothing else
would. Remember only that my term finished March 15. I
tremble for your answer, but beg it may be speedy. I am too
much agitated to go on. I will tell you something of myself in
my next, <em>i.e.</em> very soon.</p>

<p class="signature">
I am, dear Kitty,<br />
Your unfortunate nephew,<br />
<span class="smcap">E. Gibbon</span>.
</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I have enclosed a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i>&mdash;write there a promise
for what you send me; it may serve you with my father in case of
my death.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;You may inquire for Grand and Wombwell, bankers,
who will give you bills upon Mr. Grand, banker, at Lausanne for
as much as you will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VOLTAIRE AT GENEVA.</div>

<p>As Mr. Pavilliard writes to you at present, I will not let
slip the occasion of sending my letter by the same post. Give me
leave, sir, to demand of you, once more, and to demand of you
with the last earnestness, the return of your paternal tenderness,
which I have forfeited by the unhappy step I have made. I hope
to merit that return by my behaviour. Give me leave, too, to
repeat my former demands of some masters, as for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manége</i>
for fencing and for dancing. With regard to the last, I own
that Mr. Pavilliard, overcome by importunities, and imagining
you would not disapprove of it, gave me leave to take it about
three months ago, and I actually learn. My health still continues
good, and I continue my studies in the same manner I have
already described to you. The only news I have to tell you is
that the famous Mr. de Voltaire<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is come to spend, as he says, the
rest of his days here. He has bought an estate near Geneva,
where he proposes to spend the summer, and to pass the winter at
a country house he has hired near Lausanne.</p>

<p>Give me now leave, dear Sir, to finish, repeating the demand
of your former affection. If I could hope to hear from you I
should think myself completely happy.</p>

<p class="head">
September 20th, 1755.

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>In compliance with your request, I answer the very day
I have received it. I own you had vexed me; not so much in
refusing me the money I asked you, as by revealing the thing to
my father. But what is done cannot be undone, and as my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
has forgiven me, I think I may do as much for you. I consent,
then, to the renewal of our correspondence with all my heart. I
shall begin by the tail of your letter. My whole debt was not
with Gee; a great part was with a person of this town, who has
heard reason easily enough. He has consented to receive a note
by which I own the debt, and promise to pay him when I can.
Gee has not been so easy. After having obliged him to take back
the watch and the mare, the debt was still at fifty guineas. I
bought him for twenty another watch, paying (as I do still) two
guineas a month to the watchmaker, and which Mons. Pavilliard
and I contrive to retrench out of my other expenses. Gee left us
about four months ago. Have you a mind to know his destiny?
Yes. Hear it, then. His parents had ordered him forty guineas
for his journey, but as they had allowed him to stay a fortnight
at Paris, he was to take twenty more in that place. Gee quits
Lausanne in this manner. Suppose him at Lyons. He goes
immediately to the correspondent of his banker, for whom he had
a letter of recommendation. "Sir," says he, in accosting him, "I
have a letter for you from your correspondent, Mons. Grand of
Lausanne. You will find in it that he desires you to pay me
twenty-five guineas at sight." The banker puts on his spectacles,
reads the letter, but finds nothing in it about money. Upon
which he tells Gee that certainly there is some mistake, and he
cannot give him a farthing before it is cleared up. Gee replies
that he must be at Paris a certain day, and that without money
he cannot go. In a word, for I hate long stories, the banker
gives him the money, but writes to his correspondent at Paris to
stop Gee's twenty guineas. He, having some wind of the affair,
runs post, day and night, arrives at Paris four hours before the
letter, and draws the money. Gee's adventures at Paris would
take up a volume, as he played a great deal. Once he had a
hundred and fifty thousand livres, French money, in his pocket
(£6700), but a week after he was 1500 guineas in debt, thanks to
the famous Mr. Taff<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and some others of much the same stamp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
The end was <em>that his mother, though extremely poor, paid all his
debts</em>, and sent him into England, where he is now, having lost
his commission, having hardly any other resource than his
Majesty's highway. So much for Gee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS FATHER'S SECOND MARRIAGE</div>

<p>A tear to poor Nell; she really deserves it. Am glad Nemmy
is well married. Would write to my aunt Hester,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> but know not
what to say to her. You tell me Snell and Milton are gone;
where? Compliments to Bett Gilbert and to the Darrels<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> since
you are at Richmond. I hurry over; but, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</i>, who directed
your letter, for it is not your hand? I hurry over all these
things to come to my father's marriage.</p>

<p>About a fortnight ago I received a vastly kind letter from my
father of the 18th of August (inquire the day of his marriage).
He forgave me in it all my past faults, promised never to speak
of them again to me, provided only I kept the promises I had
made him about my future behaviour; allows me to make a little
tour about Switzerland, which I had asked him, and tells me
that, after having completed my studies and my exercises, he
would make me make that of France and Italy. But not a
syllable about his marriage.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Three days after I heard of it by
the canal of a certain Mr. Hugonin, whose father is our neighbour
in Hampshire, but without any particularities either of name or
anything else. Guess my surprise; you know he had always protested
that he never would marry again&mdash;at least, had he done it
in the time he was angry with me, I should have been less struck;
but now what can he mean by it? What frightens me most is
what I remember you told me; if my father married again, by my
grandfather's will the estate went to the children of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
bed, and that I had only 200 a year, provided the second wife
had more fortune than my mother, who had only £1500. You
may easily guess the anxiety that has put me in. I have wrote
to a friend in England, who I think I can trust to get me a copy
of that will out of Doctors' Commons; but though sure of his
discretion, I do not know whether he will care to serve me.
<em>Could you not do it YOURSELF?</em> and inquire whether my father
has not taken care of me by his marriage contract.</p>

<p>You say that Mrs. Gibbon (Miss Patton) has set my father
against the Mallets.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I do not know if 'tis so very good a sign.
Since she was intimate with him when I was under Ward's<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> hands,
I should think you must have heard something of her. Do make
some inquiries about her and send them me. I wonder what will
become of my poor cousin. She will be sold at last. Since they
are in France, and that the war is going to break out, what if
they should come to Lausanne?</p>

<div class="sidenote">YOUNG TRAVELLERS.</div>

<p>*Now for myself. As my father has given me leave to make a
journey round Switzerland, we set out to-morrow. Buy a map of
Switzerland, 'twill cost you but a shilling, and follow me. I go
by Iverdun, Neufchâtel, Bienne or Biel, Soleure or Solothurn,
Bâle or Basil, Bade, Zurich, Lucerne, and Bern. The voyage will
be of about four weeks; so that <em>I hope to find a letter from you
waiting for me</em>. As my father had given me leave to learn what I
had a mind, I have learned to ride, and learn actually to dance
and draw. Besides that, I often give ten or twelve hours a day
to my studies. I find a great many agreeable people here; see
them sometimes, and can say upon the whole, without vanity,
that, tho' I am the Englishman here who spends the least money,
I am he who is the most generally liked. I told you that my
father had promised to send me into France and Italy. I have
thanked him for it. But if he would follow my plan, he won't do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it yet a while. I never liked young travellers; they go too raw
to make any great remarks, and they lose a time which is (in my
opinion) the most precious part of a man's life. My scheme
would be, to spend this winter at Lausanne&mdash;for tho' 'tis a very
good place to acquire the air of good company and the French
tongue, we have no good professors&mdash;to spend (I say) the winter
at Lausanne; go into England to see my friends a couple of
months, and after that, finish my studies, either at Cambridge
(for after what's past one cannot think of Oxford), or at a university
in Holland. If you liked the scheme, <em>could you propose it to
my father by Metcalf, or somebody else who has a certain credit
over him</em>? I forgot to ask you whether, in case my father writes
to tell me his marriage, would you advise me to compliment my
mother-in-law? I think so. My health is so very regular that I
have nothing to say about it.</p>

<p>I have been the whole day writing you this letter; the preparations
for our voyage gave me a thousand interruptions.
Besides that, I was obliged to write in English. This last reason
will seem a parradox, but I assure you the French is much more
familiar to me.* <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À propos</i>, do you know anything of my Lord
Newnham?<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> I heard he was in Germany.</p>

<p class="head">
10 juin 1756.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Mon très cher Père</span>,
</p>

<p>Je reçus hier votre lettre avec beaucoup de plaisir, mais
qui ne fut pas tout-à-fait sans mélange d'Inquietude. Je craignois
vous avoir encore offensé par quelque nouvelle faute. Vous savez
combien une affection vive et sincère prend facilement l'allarme
aux plus grandes minucies. Je fus frappé en ouvrant votre lettre
de voir votre style ordinaire de Dear Edward changé en un froid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Monsieur. Il est vrai que la suite me rassura; j'y voyois un Père
tendre qui vouloit bien entrer dans mes peines, les soulager, et me
delivrer de toutes mes craintes, en m'assurant que, si je me
conduisois toujours d'une façon conforme à mon devoir, le nouvel
engagement qu'il avoit pris ne me porteroit aucune prejudice.
J'espère que je me connois assez à présent pour pouvoir regarder
cette condition comme une promesse absolue. En effet si je m'en
écartois, avec quels yeux pourrois-je me regarder moi-même après
m'être coupable d'une aussi noire ingratitude pour tant de bonté?
Ce trait dont vous me faites part au sujet de votre nouvelle épouse,
me la fait déjà aimer d'avance. Je n'aurai pas beaucoup de peine
à considérer comme ma mère celle qui, ne pouvant pas me donner
la vie, me l'a au moins rendu. J'aurai l'honneur de lui en faire
mes très humbles remerciemens, et de l'assurer des v&oelig;ux qui je
fais pour son bonheur. Pour vous, mon très cher Père, je puis
vous protester dans la sincerité de mon c&oelig;ur que tous ceux que je
fais à votre sujet ont pour unique but votre felicité mutuelle.
Puissiez-vous gouter tous les agreémens d'une Union fondée sur
l'amour et l'estime, et puisse je vous réiterer ces mêmes souhaits
pendant une longue suite d'années.</p>

<p>Vous me demandez compte de mes études et de mes exercises.
Pour vous en rendre il faut nécessairement que j'entre dans un
certain détail. Vos questions la-dessus peuvent se rapporter: 1. à
mon François. Je sais qu'il s'en faut de beaucoup que je ne
possède cette langue aussi bien que je pourrois le faire. Mais
j'ose dire pourtant, sans craindre d'en être démenti par Monsieur
Pavilliard, que je la sais mieux que la plupart des Anglois que
j'ai vu à Lausanne. 2. Mes Langues mortes. Vous savez mieux
que personne ma faiblesse par rapport au Latin lorsque j'ai quitté
l'Angleterre. Il n'y avoit alors point d'auteur que je pusse lire
avec facilité ni par conséquent avec plaisir. A present il n'y en
aucun que je ne lise coulamment. J'en ai lu plusieurs depuis
quelque peu de tems, tels que la plus grande partie des ouvrages
de Ciceron, Virgile, Saluste, les Epitres de Pline deux fois, les
comédies de Terence autant, Velleius Patercule, et je me propose
de les lire tous avec le tems. Pour ce qui est du Grec comme je
n'ai commencé à l'aprendre que depuis un mois, ou six semaines,
vous sentez bien que j'en suis encore aux Premiers Principes.
3. Ma Philosophie. J'ai achevé la Logique de Monsieur de
Crousaz laquelle est fort estimée dans ce pays-ci, en partie avec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Monsieur Pavilliard et en parti dans mon Particulier. Je vais
lire pour la seconde fois L'Etendement Humain, et, aussitôt que
je l'aurai fini, je commencerai l'Algèbre que vous me recommandez
tant. 4. Ma Danse et mon Dessein. Je crois que vous
ne serez pas mécontent de mes progrés dans la dernière de ces
choses. Pour ce de la première je fais tout ce que je puis.
Monsieur Pavilliard me rendra la justice de dire je ne suis pas
fort dissipé. Je ne sors pas beaucoup et alors même ce n'est que
pour aller dans les compagnies de la ville.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS STUDIES.</div>

<p>Je suis bien faché, mon très cher Père, de voir que ces malheureux
mots de Mons. Hugonin, lachés et rapportés si mal à propos,
ne sont pas encore effacés de votre esprit. Je vous en demande sincèrement
excuse, et je vous prie de les oublier totalement. Pour
ce qui est de mon ...<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> que j'avois parlé à ma Tante, je voudrois
n'en avoir jamais parlé puisqu'il vous déplait. J'avoue pourtant
que l'ayant mûrement reconsideré je n'y ai point pu decouvrir
l'Incongruité dont vous me parlez. Comme ma Tante vous a
montré mes lettres je ne repeterai point ce que j'y ai dit. Je
remarquerai seulement qui ce même Locke dont vous me conseilliez
tant la Lecture, pense tout comme moi au sujet des voyages
prematures.</p>

<p>Je me hate de vous assurer encore une fois de mes
sentimens. Je ne crois pas qu'ils vous soient inconnus, mais je
me plais à les repeter; heureux si les expressions de mon c&oelig;ur ne
vous deplaisent pas.</p>

<p>Quand pourrois-j'esperer de vous les temoigner, ces sentimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
en Angleterre? Quatre ans se sont déjà ecoulés depuis qu'un
arret de votre part m'a fixé dans ce pays. Ils m'ont paru autant
de siècles. Ce n'est pas que je me plaigne du pays même ni de
ses habitans. Je leur ai des obligations essentielles. Je dois
au séjour que j'y ai fait mon gout pour la culture de mon
esprit, et les progrès quelqu'ils soient que j'ai fait dans quelques
genres d'études. Je me suis même acquis un petit nombre
d'amis qui meritent mon estime, et dont le souvenir me sera
toujours cher. Mais ces amis que sont-ils au prix d'un père
à qui je dois tout, d'une mère qui a autant de droit sur ma
reconnoissance que sur mon respect, d'une Tante que j'aimai dès
que je la connus, et qui je connus aussitôt que moi-même? Je
ne repasserai pas toutes les raisons dont je me suis déjà servi,
pour faire voir que, quelques soient vos intentions, un plus long
séjour à Lausanne ne me peut être que nuisible. Je vous les ai
proposé, c'est à vous à les peser. Mais permettez-moi, mon très
cher Père, de vous prier de refléchir serieusement quel effet le
différent emploi de mes plus belles années peut avoir sur le reste
de ma vie. Je ne fais point entrer en ligne de compte mon
propre agrément, c'est un objet trop leger pour être mis à coté de
ceux-ci. Au moins, quelques soient vous resolutions, ne m'accablez
pas par le silence. Que je les apprenne de vous, ce sera toujours
pour moi une sorte de consolation.</p>

<p>Mais si des raisons que je n'ai gardé de blamer vous engagent
á me laisser plus longtems dans ce pays; adoucissez au moins ma
situation. Je vous ai souvent demandé la liberté de prendre un
Domestique. Je vous le demande encore comme le douceur qui
me seroit le plus sensible. Comme je sais, mon cher Père, que
vous n'aimez pas beaucoup à écrire des lettres, si après six semaines
ou deux mois, je regarderai votre silence comme un consentement.</p>

<p>Je n'ai rien de nouveau à vous dire sur ma santé ni sur mes
études. Celle-la est passable; je fais tout ce je puis pour qu'on
puisse dire quelque chose de plus de celles-ci.</p>

<p>Assurez ma chère mère (c'est avec bien du plaisir que je lui
donne ce titre) de tous les sentimens que ce nom sacré emporte
avec lui. J'ai l'honneur d'être, mon très cher Père, avec le plus
profond respect et le plus tendre devouement</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS FATHER'S SILENCE.</div>

<p>Dois-je me flatter que vous m'aimiez encore? Si j'en
croyois mes propres sentimens, je me dirais sur le champ que j'aime
mon père avec une tendresse si vive et si vraie qu'il est impossible
que je ne sois pas payé de retour. Si j'ai bien entendu ses paroles,
ajoutais-je à moi-même. Ce père, ci-devant si rempli de bonté,
m'a daigné assurer que tout étoit oublié et qu'il me rendoit son
ancienne affection. Je ne dois donc plus en douter. Il m'aime,
je suis heureux. Cependant d'un autre coté mille Idées facheuses
s'offroient en foule à mon esprit. Je lui ai écrit plusieurs
fois, je lui ai demandé des graces que je croyois raisonnables, et
que j'esperois d'obtenir. Il se tait cependant. Un silence si cruel
m'afflige, m'épouvante, me fait envisager le plus grand des malheurs:
la perte de son amitié. Ne croyez pas, mon très cher Père,
qu'il entre le moindre réproche dans ces plaintes, le respectueux
attachement que j'aurai pour vous m'en interdit jusqu'à l'apparence.
Vous avez sans doute vos raisons, et quand même elles me
paroitroient pas tout à fait suffisantes, mon devoir, et, plus encore,
mon c&oelig;ur feroient taire ma faible raison et vous assureroient
d'une obeissance libre de tout murmure.</p>

<p>Lorsque vous me permettez, il y a deux ans, de faire le tour
de la Suisse, de peur de faire une depense trop forte, nous laissâmes
Genève pour une autre fois. Je viens de faire ce petit
voyage actuellement. J'y ai passé trois ou quatre semaines que
j'ai taché de mettre à profit. Ma depense pendant ce tems là est
allée à seize Louis neufs. J'espère, mon très cher Père, que vous
ne la désapprouverez pas. Je ne l'aurois pas fait sans prèalablement
demander votre permission, mais le tems pressoit. Une
troupe de Comédiens François étoient à Genève en passant. Il
étoit bien naturel de saisir une occasion de prendre quelque Idée
du Théâtre François, et cette occasion (vu la Guerre) ètoit
presque unique. De retour à Lausanne, j'ai repris mes anciennes
occupations avec une ardeur nouvelle. Assurez, s'il vous plait,
madame votre epouse de mon sincère Attachement, et faites moi la
justice de me croire avec une tendresse et un respect sans bornes</p>

<p>It is with the greatest pleasure that I see the time
approach in which I may hope to enjoy what I have so long
desired, your presence and the view of my native country. With
regard to the road, the war<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> renders all roads almost impracticable.
However, after having consulted the persons most used to travelling,
they all agree that that of France will be the least dangerous. I
shall pass for a Swiss Officer in Holland. I shall have Dutch
Regimentals, and a passeport from the Canton of Berne. I am
pretty sure that my Tongue won't betray me. I think of setting
out the 8th or 10th of next month, and if I stay a few days
in Holland to look a little about me, I may be in London the
2nd or 3rd of May, where I hope to meet you. I return you
beforehand my most hearty thanks for your condescendance in
concurring with my impatience. Tho' you think I shall not
relish Beriton, I can assure you that the prospect of passing the
summer in yours &amp; Mrs. Gibbon's compagny, dividing my time
between successive study, exercise, and ease, is the most agreable
one I can conceive. I shall punctually follow your directions
about money, and shall not abuse of the confidence you have in
me. Be so good as to assure Mrs. Gibbon of all the sentiments
Esteem and duty can inspire. As I run post I cannot bring her
the Arquebuzade Water myself, but I shall remit to a waggoner,
who will be at London almost as soon as I, several bottles of the
very best I can find.</p>

never enjoyed the happiness of living near her, and of instructing
myself not less by her example than by her precepts. Your piety,
Madam, has engaged you to prefer a retreat to the world. Errors,
justifiable only in their principle, forced my father to give me a
foreign education. Fully disabused of the unhappy ideas I had
taken up, and at last restored to myself, I am happy in the affection

my felicity compleat by the acquisition of your esteem and friendship?
Duty and Inclination engage me equally to solicit them,
all my endeavours shall tend to deserve them, and, with Mrs.
Gibbon, I know that to deserve is to obtain. I have now been in
England about two months, and should have acquitted myself
much sooner of my duty, but frequent journeys to London scarce
left me a moment to myself, and since a very ugly fever my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>

Sunday evening. We have got our old lodgings in Charles

forgetfulness of leaving money in my bureau may perhaps hinder
me from buying my own myself. We have no great news in
town, but that, one day, Sir George Elkin, a man of family and
fortune, has married Miss Roach, a woman of the town. Everybody
pities him. He is but eighteen: unluckily they were married
in Scotland. She stayed five days with him, the sixth she ran

<div class="sidenote">A VISIT TO LONDON</div>

<p>I arrived in town between four and five o'clock safe and
well, though almost frozen.&mdash;Turton<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> was not to be found, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
I will endeavour to see him to-morrow; though I believe that
change of air and scene will be of greater benefit to me, than any
prescriptions he can order me.&mdash;I write from Mrs. Porten's,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
who begs to be remembered to you in the kindest terms. She is
totally ignorant of <em>forms</em>, but will see Mrs. Darrel to-morrow
morning and endeavour to settle everything. Let me entreat you,
my dearest Mrs. Gibbon, to try to divert thoughts, which cannot
be suppressed, and believe me that I can only be easy as I have
reason to think that you are so.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>I must begin by the most disagreeable news I have to
tell you. All our tickets have come up blanks.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> All our visionary
plans of grandeur are disappointed, the dream of those who have
had the ten thousand pounds will last a little, but perhaps, not
much longer.</p>

<p>I am settled at last in a very good lodging; I say at last
because I lived a day and a half at Mrs. Porten's in the middle of
hurry and noise and meazels. My aunt desires her compliments
to you and Mrs. Gibbon. We eat the levret together. Pray did
you not send her a hare some time ago? I know not what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
happened, but she never received it. I saw at her house Dr.
Maty's son,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a little odd cur, and by an unexampled generosity I
tipped the boy with a crown and the father with a coal of fire.
Last night I was at the King's Scholars play, and, proper allowances
being made, was very well entertained. All spoke justly
enough and some (one or two) promised a good deal. Harry
Courtenay was one of these, but he disappointed me before the end
of the play. He came on with ease and entered well into his
character (an old man in the Phormio), got safe over the dreadful
first scene. From thence he sunk gradually tho' encouraged
by repeated claps, dragged himself through the last scenes in the
most dead and lifeless manner. My expectations were deceived
more than they ever were in my whole life. I am just come from
Madame Cilesia's.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> She received me in a dirty white linnen gown,
no rufles; in a word, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a negligé qui n'alloit pas le mieux du monde,
à sa Majesté Corse</i>. She received me, however, like an old fellow-sufferer.
Not that we talked at all of the M.....s, tho' on
the brink of it several times, but neither of us broke the ice. I do
not think her pretty, something sweet enough in her face, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mais
enfin voilà tout</i>. I am to dine there to-morrow. To-day I dine
in state at home, and after dinner shall go to Cleone,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> though
generally disliked.</p>

<p>I lodge in New Bond Street at a linnen draper's, a Mr. Steward,
and I have a very good first floor, dining-room, bed-chamber and
light closet with many conveniences for a guinea and half a
week. I believe I shall keep to it. Lee is very serviceable to me,
he has got me a very handsome chair for twenty-seven shillings.</p>

</p>

<p>How many thanks have I to return you! I shall wait
upon Sir William Milner<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> as soon as he is in town, and do not
doubt of liking that family, at least the lady: to say she is your
friend is a sufficient enconium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WANT OF MONEY</div>

<p>But, Madam, I am really concerned my father has not sent
me a draught. I am really distressed for money. I have hardly
a guinea left, and you know the unavoidable expences of London.
I have tryed to borrow of Mrs. Porten and of Harvey, my father's
lawyer. But without success. Could not you send me a bank-note
by the Hastings Post of Monday? I would run all the risks of
its being lost; for upon my word I shall hardly know what to
do in three or four days.</p>

<p>Will you admit my excuse? I am just going to see Garrick,

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>I am afraid you will be angry at seeing a letter instead
of me, but indeed I knew not how disagreeable it was, travelling
in this season. I am besides invited to Mrs. Wray's and Mr.
Darrel's for next Monday and Wednesday. Do you think these
reasons sufficient? (I beg you would tell it me freely.) If you
do not I will endeavour to come down the latter end of next
week; as I suppose my being there Christmas Day is of no
consequence.</p>

<p>I have seen Dr. Maty. <em>La La.</em> He made little or no excuse
for having deferred writing, but has already criticised it with
sense and severity. He finds it as I hoped; good, in general,
but many faults in the detail.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>I have dined once with M. Cilesia, with whom I am extremely
pleased; he has wit and learning, and speaks French like a
Parisian. But pray have you heard the shocking pretensions of
Mlle. de Vaucluse? A prior marriage with him, or at least a
promise of Marriage with a vast forfeiture. I do not know the
particulars, but she pushes the affair vigorously at Genoa, and disperses
a Memoire, which I hope to see. If she is not an Imposture,
how criminal it makes the husband and how unhappy the wife.</p>

<p>I believe it is needless to assure Mrs. Gibbon of my sincerest
love and regard. Pray tell her Sir W. Milner is in town. I
shall execute all her and your commissions.</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS FIRST LITERARY VENTURE</div>

<p>Your illness really alarmed me. To be taken in so
sudden and violent a manner. If you had not assured me that
you was so much better, I would have set out immediately for
Beriton. I hope you have had some advice better than Harvey's.
I hope too that Mrs. Gibbon tries to hinder you from going out
in the cold. I say tries, because I know that with regard to
going out you are a most ungovernable patient.</p>

<p>At last Maty and I have downright quarrelled. He behaved
so very contemptuously to me. Never made the least excuse for
having eked out two weeks into two months, left two letters I
wrote him since, without any answers, never came near me, that
at last I desired him to send back my manuscript. He did so.
I then wrote him a letter to explain my behaviour. He answered
it by another politely bitter. So <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout est fini</i>!</p>

<p>I return you, Dear Sir, my sincerest thanks for telling me
of my faults. I shall always consider it the truest proof of your
affection for me. I hope you do not impute my not writing to
Mrs. Gibbon to the least want of regard for her. I should be
the most ungrateful of men, if I did not love and respect her like
my own mother. But I really thought that in a union like yours,
writing to one was writing to both. However, dear Sir, it is
enough that you think it an omission, for me to repair it by the
very next post.</p>

<p>I endeavour to see no company in town but such as you
yourself would approve of. Mrs. Cilesia's and Mrs. Hayes's are
the two houses I frequent the most. The former has promised
to introduce me to Lady Harvey's<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Assembly, where ('tis true
though wonderful) there is no card-playing, but very good
company and very good conversation. I am also to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
at Mrs. Cilesia's the great David Hume. I shall seek his
acquaintance without being discouraged by Maty.</p>

<p>I have answered Bordot's letter. He desires a present relief,
a quick release, and a good place in England. The first alone is
in my power. I beg you would give him Five Guineas and deduct
it upon the Christmas quarter of my Allowance. I do not doubt
but you will do something for him, as I really think his situation
deserves pity. This cessation of the prisoner's allowance shows,
I think, better than fifty monitors to how low an ebb the French
are reduced. I cannot help pitying them too. I do not think it
necessary to have no compassion, in order to be a good Englishman.
My unfashionable politicks are that a war can hardly be a
good one, and a peace hardly a bad one. My sincerest love and
regard wait upon Mrs. Gibbon.</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>*An address in writing, from a person who has the
pleasure of being with you every day, may appear singular. However,
I have preferred this method, as upon paper I can speak
without a blush, and be heard without interruption. If my
letter displeases you, impute it, Dear Sir, only to yourself. You
have treated me not like a son, but like a friend. Can you
be surprized that I should communicate to a friend all my
thoughts, and all my desires? Unless the friend approve them,
let the father never know them; or, at least, let him know at the
same time, that however reasonable, however eligible, my scheme
may appear to me, I would rather forget it for ever, than cause
him the slightest uneasiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">UNFITNESS FOR POLITICAL LIFE.</div>

<p>When I first returned to England, attentive to my future
interest, you were so good as to give me hopes of a seat in Parliament.
This seat, according to the Custom of our venal country,
was to be bought, and fifteen hundred pounds were mentioned as
the price of the purchase. This design flattered my vanity, as it
might enable me to shine in so august an assembly. It flattered
a nobler passion; I promised myself that by the means of this
seat I might be one day the instrument of some good to my
country. But I soon perceived how little a mere virtuous inclination,
unasisted by talents, could contribute towards that great end;
and a very short examination discovered to me, that those talents
were not fallen to my lot. Do not, Dear Sir, impute this declaration
to a false modesty, the meanest species of pride. Whatever
else I may be ignorant of, I think I know myself, and shall
always endeavour to mention my good qualities without vanity,
and my defects without repugnance. I shall say nothing of the
most intimate acquaintance with his country and language, so
absolutely necessary to every Senator. Since they may be
acquired, to alledge my deficiency in them, would seem only the
plea of laziness. But I shall say with great truth, that I never
possessed that gift of speach, the first requisite of an Orator,
which use and labour may improve, but which nature can alone
bestow. That my temper, quiet, retired, somewhat reserved,
could neither acquire popularity, bear up against opposition,
nor mix with ease in the crowds of public life. That even
my genius (if you will allow me any) is better qualified for the
deliberate compositions of the Closet, than for the extemporary
discourses of the Parliament. An unexpected objection would
disconcert me; and as I am incapable of explaining to others
what I do not thoroughly understand myself, I should be meditating,
while I ought to be answering. I even want necessary
prejudices of party, and of nation. In popular assemblies, it
is often necessary to inspire them; and never Orator inspired
well a passion, which he did not feel himself. Suppose me even
mistaken in my own Character; to set out with the repugnance
such an opinion must produce, offers but an indifferent prospect.
But I hear you say It is not necessary that every man should
enter into Parliament with such exalted hopes. It is to acquire
a title the most glorious of any in a free country, and to employ
the weight and consideration It gives in the service of one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
friends. Such motifs, tho' not glorious, yet are not dishonourable;
and if we had a borough in our command, if you could
bring me in without any great expence, or if our fortune enabled
us to dispise that expence, then indeed I should think them of
the greatest strength. But with our private fortune is it worth
while to purchase at so high a rate, a title, honourable in itself,
but which I must share with every fellow that can lay out Fifteen
hundred pounds? Besides, Dear Sir, a merchandize is of little
value to the owner, when he is resolved not to sell it.</p>

<p>I should affront your penetration, did I not suppose you now
see the drift of this letter. It is to appropriate to another use
the sum you destined to bring me into Parliament; to employ it,
not in making me great, but in rendering me happy. I have
often heard you say yourself, that the allowance you had been so
indulgent as to grant me, tho' very liberal in regard to your
estate, was yet but small, when compared with the almost necessary
extravagances of the age. I have indeed found it so, notwithstanding
a good deal of &oelig;conomy, and an exemption from
many of the common expences of youth. This, Dear Sir, would
be a way of supplying these deficiencies, without any additional
expence to you.&mdash;But I forbear.&mdash;If you think my proposals
reasonable, you want no entreaties to engage you to comply with
them; if otherwise, all will be without effect.</p>

<p>All that I am afraid of, Dear Sir, is, that I should seem not so
much asking a favour, as this really is, as exacting a debt. After
all I can say, you will still remain the best judge of my good, and
your own circumstances. Perhaps, like most Landed Gentlemen,
an addition to my annuity would suit you better than a sum
of money given at once. Perhaps the sum itself may be too considerable.
Whatever you shall think proper to bestow upon me,
or in whatever manner, will be received with equal gratitude.</p>

<p>I intended to stop here; but as I abhor the least appearance
of art, I think it will be better to lay open my whole scheme
at once. The unhappy War which now desolates Europe, will
oblige me to defer seeing France till a peace. But that reason
can have no influence upon Italy, a country which every Scholar
must long to see; should you grant my request, and not disaprove
of my manner of employing your bounty, I would leave
England this autumn, and pass the winter at Lausanne, with
M. de Voltaire and my old friends. The armies no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
obstruct my passage, and it must be indifferent to you, whether I
am at Lausanne or at London during the winter, since I shall not
be at Beriton. In the spring I would cross the Alps, and after
some stay in Italy, as the war must then be terminated, return
home thro' France, to live happily with you and my dear Mother.
I am now two or three and twenty; a tour must take up a considerable
time, and tho' I believe you have no thoughts of settling
me soon, (and I am sure I have not) yet so many things may
intervene, that the man who does not travel early, runs a great
risk of not travelling at all. But this part of my scheme, as well
as the whole, I submit entirely to you.</p>

<p>Permit me, Dear Sir, to add, that I do not know whether the
compleat compliance with my wishes could encrease my love and
gratitude; but that I am very sure, no refusal could minish
those sentiments with which I shall always remain, Dear Sir, your
most dutiful and obedient son and servant,*</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>Knowing you as I do I can easily judge of the effect
my father's accident must have produced upon you. Besides, I
can guess at it by the impression it made upon me, though I
heard of the danger and the escape at the same time. I thank
God it was no worse. I hope my father is now thoroughly
recovered. I shall remember the Arquebusade this week.</p>

<p>Of myself and my situation at the Devizes I have little to say,
and that little not very agreeable. A great deal of noise and no
conversation, a great many people and no society, a most excessive
familiarity and no friendship; in a word, the usual scene, only I
think we are not so quarrelsome as we used to be.</p>

<p>I wrote to my father who by this time must have received my
letter. However I must just mention to him two or three things
relative to the battalion. He will see by the enclosed return, our
strength and what we have done, which is nothing to what we
might do had we money. The Blacks<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> now grow so numerous
that I think they must drive us out of town, they desire it so
strongly, &amp; Lord Shelbourne<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> has such powerful interest. I believe
Sharrock<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> will get an ensign, one Hall,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> near this place, a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
pretty lad of sixteen with a good qualification, though not in our

has not yet wrote either to Harrison<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> or me.</p>

<p>How does your pupil go on? I hope soon to have an account
of him, as William is very clamourous for a new livery.</p>

<p>You say nothing of your brother. I hope he is sailed. Surely
it must by this time be determined. I beg you would present
my love and duty to my father, and believe me,</p>

Paris, February the 12th, 1763.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>You remember our agreement; short and frequent
letters. The first part of the treaty you have no doubt of my
observing: I think I ought not to leave you any of the second.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À propos</i> of treaty,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> our definitive one was signed here yesterday,
and this morning the Duke of Bridgewater and Mr. Neville<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> went
for London with the news of it. The plenipotentiaries sat up till
ten o'Clock in the morning at the ambassador of Spain's ball, and
then went to sign this treaty which regulates the fate of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARISIAN SOCIETY.</div>

<p>Paris in most respects, has fully answered my expectations.
I have a number of very good acquaintances which encrease every
day, for nothing is so easy as the making them here. Instead of
complaining of the want of them, I begin already to think of
making a choice. Next Sunday for instance I have only three
invitations to Dinner. Either in the houses you are already
acquainted, you meet with people who ask you to come and see
them, or some of your friends offer themselves to introduce you.
When I speak of these connections, I mean chiefly for dinner &amp;
the evening. Suppers, as yet I am pretty much a stranger to,
and I fancy shall continue so: for Paris is divided into two
Species who have but little communication with each other. The
one who is chiefly connected with the men of letters dine very
much at home, are glad to see their friends, and pass the evenings
till about nine in agreable and rational conversation. The others
are the most fashionable, sup in numerous parties, and always
play or rather game both before and after supper. You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
easily guess which sort suits me best. Indeed, Madam, we may
say what we please of the frivolity of the French, but I do assure
you that in a fortnight passed at Paris I have heard more conversation
worth remembering, and seen more men of letters
among the people of fashion, than I had done in two or three
winters in London.</p>

<p>Amongst my acquaintance I cannot help mentioning M. Helvetius,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
the author of the famous book <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de l'Esprit</i>. I met him at
dinner at Madame Geoffrin's,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> where he took great notice of me,
made me a visit next day, &amp; has ever since treated me not in a
polite but a friendly manner. Besides being a sensible man an
agreable companion, &amp; the worthiest creature in the world He
has a very pretty wife, a hundred thousand Livres a year and one
of the best tables in Paris. The only thing I dislike in him is
his great attachment to and admiration for Stanley,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> whose
character is indeed at Paris beyond any thing you can conceive.
To the great civility of this foreigner, who was not obliged to
take the least notice of me, I must just contrast the behaviour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the D. of B.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> I could not see him (on account of his gout) till
last Sunday. I was then introduced to him &amp; presented my letter
from the D[uke] of R[ichmond].<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He received me civilly,
desired I would apply to him whenever I wanted his assistance,
and thus dismissed me. I have not heard of him since. Indeed
I have often blushed for him, for I find his stateliness and
avarice make him the joke of Paris. Instead of keeping any
thing of a publick table, he hardly ever asks any body; while
the Spaniard<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> gives balls every week, the magnificence of which
is only exceeded by their politeness &amp; elegance. Neville who is
exactly Mr. W. Patton<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> received me very well, but seemed to
laugh both at Mallet &amp; his letter of recommendation.</p>

<p>I beg my duty to my father to whom I propose writing next
week, and my most sincere compliments to the two Gentlemen.</p>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Paris, March the 25th, 1763.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>I am afraid (as dates are stubborn things) that I have
been rather too lazy. As you love truth, and know me, I will not
attempt an awkward apology, but shall only say, that I will
endeavor such a delay shall not happen a second time. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
father has more extensive priviledges, and indeed he seems to be
very well acquainted with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRIENDS IN PARIS</div>

<p>I still continue to like Paris, as well as I expected. You
know that is saying a great deal. In two months I am acquainted
with more, (and more agreable) people, than I knew in London
in two years. Indeed the way of life is quite different. Much
less play, more conversation, and instead of our immense routs,
agreable societies where you know and are known by almost
every body you meet. I have added several families to those I
have already mentioned to you, and I find my conquests multiply
every day. With regard to Mrs. M.'s son,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> I am glad to see that
for once she has not exagerated; indeed she hardly could in
speaking of him. We are now very intimate, &amp; I think I begin
to know his character. It is astonishing for a young French
officer of the Guards. He is as reserved, as little a man of the
world, and as awkward as I can be. But he has a fine natural
understanding, improved upon almost every subject, a clear unprejudiced
head, and a heart which seems to be full of the noblest
sentiments of honor, probity and friendship. I will not decide
too hastily, but I believe and hope that I am forming a connection
which will last as long as my life. We see one another very often,
and in most of my visits of curiosity he generally accompagnies
me. These parties are of service to us both. I improve by the
communication of his remarks, and he has occasion to see twenty
places which he would perhaps not have seen for the too common
reason, that they were in the place he had passed all his life in.
The only unlucky circumstance is, that he has no women in his
family. A Wife or a sister are, you know, most usefull and convenient
things to bring friends together, whereas we are both
single; he in his cousin's house, I in a lodging; and in this
great town, are both obliged to get our living, which prevents our
meeting so often as we could wish. Madame Bontems<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> is a very
good sort of a woman, agreable and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans pretensions</i>. She seems
to have conceived a real motherly attachment for me. I generally
sup there three or four times a week quite in a friendly way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>I have nothing new to say of his Excellency. I have not
seen him since my last letter, and but once in all. Not a single
invitation either general or particular, and tho' I have made it
a rule to leave my name at the door, at proper intervalls, I have
never been lett in. The behavior is so very singular (especially
with <em>such a recommendation as mine</em>) that I am sometimes tempted
to think, some ill offices must have been done me. Not that I
am conscious of any thing wrong or even imprudent in my behaviour.
On the contrary, whenever I have heard the D.'s
manner of living here blamed and laughed at, I have always
thought it right to try to justify him, even against my own
conscience. Indeed I am sorry, for the honor of my country to
see how contemptible a figure he makes amongst our late enemies
and constant rivals. My only comfort is that the National
character is as much revered as his is despised. What Cromwell
wished is now litterally the case. The name of Englishman inspires
as great an idea at Paris as that of Roman could at Carthage,
after the defeat of Hannibal. Indeed the French are almost
excessive. From being very unjustly esteemed a set of pirates
and Barbarians, we are now, by a more agreable injustice, looked
upon as a nation of Philosophers and Patriots. I wish we would
consider this opinion as an encouragement to deserve a character,
which I am afraid we have not yet attained. I could add many
things (some curious enough) with regard to the reigning politicks
and publick affairs; but I have no occasion to say <em>why</em> it is
much better to talk them over in your Dressing room some time
hence. Perhaps I have even said too much already.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARIS AND LONDON CONTRASTED.</div>

<p>With regard to Paris itself, I mean the houses and buildings,
you know very well that their people of fashion are incomparably
better lodged there than in London. Their vast Hotels,
courts, stables, gardens, are very magnificent as well as convenient.
A striking proof of the difference is the situation of
our Embassador. He is full as well if not better lodged, in the
Rue St. Dominique, than in Bloomsbury Square. However, his
own house is reckoned one of the very best in London, and his
hired one here is, both as to size, beauty and price, far inferior
to a great many, even of that class, at Paris. Indeed I take
the article of house rent to be much higher than in London,
Did you ever hear of seven and eight hundred and even a
thousand pounds a year being given for a house unfurnished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
There are instances of it here. But as to the middling people,
even those of fashion, I like a London house better. Without a
regular porter to answer at the door, our little street-doors are
more convenient. A fine large court is a very agreable thing,
but a dark nasty gate-way is a very disagreable one. When you
get up stairs you generally meet with two rooms. If we sat as
much in our bed-chambers as they do, we have as many. They
have indeed besides, an ante-chamber ill fitted up, and much
littered, which the servants inhabit all day, except at noon and
night that it serves for an eating parlour.</p>

<p>I have just seen here two families, the one my father's
acquaintance, the other your's. The first was Mr. Prowse, who
only passed thro' Paris, in his way for Tours, to which place he
was going, with all his family, for his health. I dined with him
at Mr. Foley's<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> &amp; went about with him to several places the next
day. In consequence of some little civilities of that kind, he
asked me to dine with him the day after. He is a very agreable
sensible man, but a strange being in France. The second is
your good friend Mrs. Poyntz,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> whom I met by accident. She
talked of you, whom she adores, asked me a hundred questions
in a breath, told me all her own affairs, her tradesmen, her house-rent,
her daughter, Lord Spencer, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., and
insisted upon my calling upon her.</p>

<p>My love and duty to my father. I shall write to him next post
and hope to hear from him sometimes. I have been obliged to
draw for another hundred pounds. I do assure you I study the
&oelig;conomical art.</p>

<h3><em>To his Father.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Paris, April the 5th, 1763.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>I received your last letter with pleasure, because every
thing that comes from you gives me pleasure; but I must own it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
afflicted me very much, as I see there are several things in which
I have had the misfortune to displease either you or some other
of my friends. I must endeavour to justify myself, and I think I
can easily do it upon most of those heads.</p>

<p>Lord Litchfield<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> is angry at my writing to him. I am sorry
for it and surprized at it at the same time. I could discover
many reasons why he might not serve me, none that He could be
angry at my application to him, especially as that application was
made with all the decency and moderation, I could put into my
letter. I should with pleasure have communicated it to you, and
known your sentiments, but as we imagined here that the D. of
B. would go away very soon, I was afraid that delay might
destroy the very small hopes I had. Indeed I thought it the less
necessary as I knew already your opinion both as to the eligibility
of the thing, and the propriety of an application to the Noble
Lord. I own the giving him no direction was not a happy
specimen of my Secretarial acuracy.</p>

<p>As to my friends, Mallets, Worsleys,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Portens, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.,
I must plead guilty, very guilty indeed to the indictment. I will
not take up my time and yours in vain excuses, my best and only
excuse ought to be and shall be, more exactness for the future.
Notwithstanding Mrs. M.'s outrageousness she is the person I
trouble my head the least about. However I propose writing to
her to-night tho' with great repugnance and difficulty. I neither
chuse to go to the Bastille for sending her observations upon the
French government, nor to fill my letter full of romantick protestations
of attachment and friendship, which I do not feel for
her, and which she feels for nobody. As to La Motte I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
forgive him his complaints, when I have so much juster ones to
make of him. Follow his advice I most certainly did not, since
he never would give me any, tho' I asked him several times in as
intelligible terms as I could properly make use of. I was forced
to have recourse to my other friends, to Madame Bontems, to M.
d'Augney and to M. de Mirabeau,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and their directions have been
very usefull to me. La Motte always shewed me such a dryness,
such an unwillingness to connect himself at all with me, that I
have been at last obliged to drop him almost entirely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONDUCT OF THE DUKE OF BEDFORD.</div>

<p>Do you think, dear Sir, that I would have stood upon the
formality of a visit with the great Duke? Besides I had no
occasion to do it. He returned mine the very next day. Since
that time I have presented myself at his door once every week or
ten days without being ever let in or hearing a syllable from him.
What can I do more than sit down quiet and wonder at his
behavior?</p>

<p>I have enquired into Mr. Thos. Bradley's affair. Mr. Taaffe
is no longer at Mr. George Woolfe's. He is in a much safer
place, in the Châtelet, a prison of Paris for debt. He has settled
with his English Creditors and given up his estate at Jamaica for
the payment of his debts. He wants to compromise with his
other Creditors who are very numerous, (but as they are convinced
he wants to cheat them and that he only offers the same
estate after the other debts are cleared, which cannot be in less
than ten or fifteen years) they will hear of no compromise. All
that Mr. Bradley could do, would be to join with those Creditors
in case they should at last agree to his proposals. Mr. Taaffe's
scheme is to keep another estate at Jamaica clear of his creditors.
They on their side want to starve him into giving up that likewise.
If Mr. Bradley thinks it worth his while to push the affair,
it will be attended with some trouble and expence. He must impower
somebody at Paris to act in his name, and in order to do
so a journey to London will be necessary where he must find out
Mr. Benjamin Bobbin an Attorney beyond the Royal Exchange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
who does all that kind of business, and who will draw up a
letter of attorney in French for him, and get it certified by the
French ambassador; a formality absolutely necessary to give it
weight in this country. As to his Attorney at Paris, the necessary
delays of the Law will render it proper to have a man who is
established at * * *</p>

<p>I cannot therefore offer myself, (which I should otherwise do
with great pleasure,) and I should hope Mr. Foley would be willing
as he is certainly able to undertake it. I wish I could give Mr.
Bradley a better account, but this seems to be the true state of the
case.</p>

<p>My losses at Play have not been very considerable since I have
been here, they amount to seven Livres lost one night at Picquet.
It is indeed rather my good luck than my prudence that saves me.
All my Societies are houses where I never see a card, so that I do
not fall because I have no temptation. I find Paris however very
expensive. One article which, tho' it encreases my draughts at
present, will diminish them hereafter is cloathes, ruffles, silk stockings,
&amp;c., which after serious deliberation, I thought I had better
make a provision of at this Capital of the Fashionable world.
However as I begin to have pretty well seen Paris, I propose (if
you have no objection) setting out about the eighth of next
month, &amp; going thro' Dijon and Besançon to Lausanne to pass
two or three quiet and cheap months with my old friends there
on my way to Italy. Adieu, Dear Sir, my paper fails me and I
would avoid a cover.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>You will give me leave according to an article of our
treaty, to write you only three lines, just to tell that I am well
and where I am.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival at Besançon I saw Mr. Acton<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> directly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
He has received me with a degree not only of civility but of
friendship which astonished me, insisted upon my taking an
appartment in his house, and since my seeing him, himself and his
three sons (our Southampton friend is one) have been only taken
up in procuring me every kind of amusement, in carrying me to
all my father's friends here who have all enquired much after
him, in seeing publick places, and in parties at home and abroad.
The only inconvenience is that I have not an instant to myself
and that I am forced to write this scrawl at half an hour after one
in the morning. The day after to-morrow I set out for Lausanne,
where I shall be a little quieter. The Acton family desire to be
remembered to my father.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BESANÇON.</div>

<p>I staid four or five days at Besançon longer than I
intended, so that I got here only the 25th. It was even with
some difficulty that I could disengage myself so soon from Mr.
Acton's civilities. Indeed nothing could exceed them. Not only
they insisted upon my lodging in the house, but during the time
I passed in it, the sole business of the family seemed to be finding
out amusements for me. They carried me to the best houses
in the place, showed me whatever was worth seeing, and made
several parties for me in the country. What I saw of Besançon
pleased me so much, that, could I have stayed there without being
an inconvenience to them, I should have liked to have stayed a
few days or even weeks longer. Mr. Acton is the best sort of
man in the world, and is bent on doing everything most agreable.
He has a great deal of business, many friends and a very high
reputation. He has indeed unluckily been too long out of
England to remember his own language, and not long enough in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
France, to have learnt that of the country. He talked a vast
deal of you, and tho' it is so long since you have been there, I
have found your memory very fresh &amp; many people who have
enquired after you. The two sisters in particular of your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écuyer</i>
(I have forgot their names) talked to me by the hour of their old
friend Monsieur de Guibon. As to Acton's wife, you know the
character Mrs. Darrel gives of her, and I was sorry to find it
is pretty well established at Besançon; but she is certainly a very
agreable and sensible woman, and I should have taken her for
a very good-natured one. If she is a termagant I never saw
such a Wolf in sheep's cloathing.</p>

<p>At last, Dear Sir, I am got to Lausanne and established very
agreably among my old acquaintance, and in a way of life I like
extremely, a moderate mixture of society and study. News from
a place so very quiet and obscure you cannot expect. I have
however seen an old friend of ours who has just left us; Sir
Willoughby Aston.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> He had been here about a twelfmonth with
Lady Aston and his numerous [family], and are just gone to
Tours in France. Nobody could guess why. They lived very
cheap here; Lady Aston had as many rubbers of Whist, and Sir
Willoughby as many bottles of wine every day as they wanted.
What could they have more? Sir Willoughby asked much after
you, and was glad to see me to talk over Winchester camp and
Reading court martial.</p>

<p>A propos of our militia, I have seen that of Switzerland.
Their General review (of the Lausanne Battalion) was last Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday. I attended all three from beginning
to end, and making all proper allowances saw them with
great pleasure. They are only exercised twelve days in the year,
and tho' many of them have been in foreign services, yet you
know, Dear Sir, how very easy it is for a soldier to forget. They
went through the manual, fired by divisions and platoons, formed
the column, and square, a General discharge and charge: all very
decently, and some (especially the Grenadiers) very prettily. I
do not compare them to our militia. As we were embodied two
or three years, the comparaison would be an affront.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LAUSANNE</div>

<p>I took credit from Mr. Foley upon a Lausanne banker, who is
likewise a brother captain of Grenadiers. I have not made use of
it yet, and when I do, it shall be as sparing as possible. I have
got a few books together, and am busy upon the ancient Geography
of Italy and the reviewing my Roman history and
antiquities. If you have no objection to leaving me here till the
spring, I should like it very much and think it might be of use
to me. But I submit the thing entirely to you.</p>

<p>You will be so good, Dear Sir, as to present my sincerest love
and duty to Mrs. Gibbon, and my most affectionate compliments
to her brothers, and to believe me</p>

</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>If my own laziness did not deprive me of any right to
complain, I should say perhaps that it was a great while since I
had heard either from you or my father. I have indeed the
satisfaction of knowing my father was well the 26th of May, and I
hope he is by this time one of the Honorable Verdurers of the
forrest of Beer. Pray, a propos of English and county news, who
is our Lord Lieutenant? I had the mortification of seeing in
the paper that the Duke of Bolton was turned out (I mean had
resigned) and that the Marquis of Caernarvon was appointed in
his room. <em>I hope</em> it is not true.</p>

<p>You have often heard me talk of Lausanne and of the
pleasure I should have in seeing it again. Our imagination
generally improves upon those agreable prospects; but I can
assure you, my ideas had not heightened any part of this. A
beautifull country, great leisure for study, and a very agreable
society, make me pass my time very much to my satisfaction. I
have found all my old friends here very glad to see me, and my
countrymen, who only know the outside of the companies, are
amazed at the number of family parties I am asked to every day.
Those countrymen (whom I do not reckon as a very important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
part of my happiness) consist only in a Mr. Sidney and a Mr.
Guise.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The former (Mrs. Perry's son) is a meer boy, and the
second (a Sir John Guise of Gloucestershire's son) is a very sensible
well-bred man. Pavillard and I were really glad to see one
another. He shewed me his snuff-box which he always carries in
a wooden case for fear of spoiling it. I was at first uneasy about
my lodging. I did not chuse to see the leg of mutton roasted a
second time with a gash in it, and yet I was afraid of disobliging
my old friend. Luckily he had got into a new house and had no
room for me; so that he himself assisted me in settling in a very
agreable family which I was very well acquainted with before.
The Husband<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> who is much of a gentleman keeps the Academy,
his wife is a charming woman; and the apartments and table are
both cheap and good. I should like extremely to pass the winter
here, if my father would give me leave. Give me leave to add
(for I am sensible you may have suspicions) that no woman is
the least concerned in my desire, and that as to any old inclinations,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
they are so far from subsisting that no one can be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
opposite to them at present than myself. This I assure you of upon
my word of honor. I hope after that I need say nothing more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>I have just drawn a bill of fifty pounds sterling upon my
father. I shall do my utmost to endeavour at Economy, and I
hope here my endeavours will be successfull.</p>

<p>Present, Dear Madam, my love and duty to my father and my
sincerest compliments to your brothers. Pray let me hear from
you or my father soon.</p>

his dislike to letter-writing is <em>inconceivable</em> to me, I see I must be

winter here. I do not dissemble that my inclination would make
me desire it; but I have a much better tho' as real a motive to
alledge to him; a considerable work I am engaged in, which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
be a most usefull preparation to my tour of Italy and which I
shall not be able to finish sooner. It is a Description of the
ancient Geography of Italy, taken from the Original writers. If
I go into Italy with a work of that kind tolerably executed, I
shall carry every where about with me an accurate and lively idea
of the country, and shall have nothing to do but to insert in their
proper places my own observations as they tend either to confirm,
to confute, or to illustrate what I have met with in books. I
should not even despair, but that this mixture of study and
observation, properly digested upon my return to England, might
produce something not entirely unworthy the eye of the publick
on a subject, upon which we have no regular or compleat treatise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VOLTAIRE AS HOST AND ACTOR.</div>

<p>I made a little excursion some days ago to Geneva, not so
much for the sake of the town which I had often seen before, as
for a representation of Monsieur de Voltaire's. He lives now
entirely at Fernay, a little place in France, but only two leagues
from Geneva. He has bought the estate, and built a very pretty
tho' small house upon it. After a life passed in courts and
Capitals, the Great Voltaire is now become a meer country Gentleman,
and even (for the honor of the profession) something of a
farmer. He says he never enjoyed so much true happiness. He
has got rid of most of his infirmities, and tho' very old and lean,
enjoys a much better state of health than he did twenty years
ago. His playhouse is very neat and well contrived, situated just
by his Chappel, which is far inferior to it, tho', he says himself,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que son Christ est du meilleur faiseur de tout le pays de Gex</i>. The
play they acted was my favourite Orphan of China. Voltaire
himself acted <em>Gengis</em> and Madame Denys <em>Idamè</em>; but I do not
know how it happened: either my taste is improved or Voltaire's
talents are impaired since I last saw him.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He appeared to me now
a very ranting unnatural performer. Perhaps indeed, as I was come
from Paris, I rather judged him by an unfair comparaison, than
by his own independent value. Perhaps too I was too much
struck with the ridiculous figure of Voltaire at seventy, acting a
Tartar Conqueror with a hollow broken voice, and making love to
a very ugly niece of about fifty. The play began at eight in the
evening and ended (entertainment and all) about half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
after eleven. The whole Company was asked to stay and set
Down about twelve to a very elegant supper of a hundred Covers.
The supper ended about two, the company danced till four, when
we broke up, got into our Coaches and came back to Geneva just
as the Gates were opened. Shew me in history or fable, a famous
poet of Seventy who has acted in his own plays, and has closed the
scene with a supper and ball for a hundred people. I think the
last is the more extraordinary of the two.</p>

<p>You may imagine how glad I am to hear of the fall of our
Tyrant<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and the accession of a just and righteous prince. Lord
&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> was always our utmost wish, and I have so very good an
opinion of him as to believe he will not even plague our enemies
to oblige us. I am very glad to hear the battalion addressed
him, as you style it, and as I could not sign the general letter, I
apprehend a particular compliment to his Lordship cannot displease
him. I have accordingly wrote to him this post. My
father had formerly some thoughts of resigning the Majority to
me. It is a matter of great indifference at present, but if he has
a mind to provide against a future storm, I suppose it would be
very easily settled at present, and that my friend Poussy (who has
never answered me any more than Sir Thomas<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>) would have the
Company of course. I wish my father would consider too,
whether changes of much greater consequence might not be
effected, such as the incorporation of both battalions, &amp;c. But
these are only hints.</p>

<p>Present, Dear Madam, my love and duty to my father, my
sincerest Compliments to your Brothers, and believe me ever</p>

<h3><em>To his Father.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, September the 10th, 1763.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>This morning I received your letter, and according to
your desire prepared myself immediately to answer it.</p>

<p>I hardly thought it possible, any letter of yours could have
given me so much uneasiness. I am very sensible how many
obligations I have to you, and that in this affair you continue to
act with your usual goodness to me. If there is any fault it is
partly my own and partly that of unhappy circumstances. My
expences have been too great for our fortune. I was afraid
of it at the time; and tho' I cannot yet see that relative to my
situation of travelling and being at Paris I have launched into
any extravagancy, the consequences are equally disagreable. But
what is past cannot be recalled. With regard, Dear Sir, to the
proposal mentioned in your letter; if your own ease or happiness
had depended upon it, I should not have hesitated an instant,
but as the advantages resulting from it relate only to me you will
give me leave to canvass it freely.</p>

<p>I need not say any thing of the great inconvenience of
mortgages nor how much they eat up an estate piece meal. We
feel it but too sensibly: Sir T. R.'s is particularly disagreable,
since he has it in his power to distress us whenever he pleases by
calling for his money. I own the thought of increasing it hurts
me very much.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DECLINES TO ENTER PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p>The advantages for me would be, your being able to bring me
into Parliament, increasing my annuity and enabling me to
continue my travels. Give me leave to say, Dear Sir, that the
first has very little weight with me. I find my ambition diminish
every day, and my preference of a quiet studious life to hurry
and business grow upon me. Besides I should imagine the thing
almost impossible in the middle of a parliament and at such an
interesting period:<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and if I was in, what could I do? Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
I consulted principle or prudence, every thing seems so unsettled
that I might find myself very soon at the tail of an opposition;
(and as a total change seems to be the modern maxim of every
new Ministry,) in case I had got any thing, I should be reduced to
my former situation, with the additional mortification of having
just tasted a little more power and plenty. The encreasing my
annuity would be certainly very agreable, but as it would be only
the difference of passing four or six months every winter in
London, I should not think it equivalent. The continuing my
travels is the great object. When I am just in view of Italy, to
be obliged to give up a scheme which has been always a favourite,
would afflict me to the greatest degree.</p>

<p>Would it not be possible, Dear Sir, to think of another
scheme? One has come into my head which would set me
entirely at my ease without costing you a shilling. It would be
to change my annuity into a perpetual rent charge upon the
Estate: this I would sell immediately for an annuity upon my
own life, which would certainly give me Six hundred pounds a
year, would enable me to travel (at least with a small addition)
and to live afterwards in a very agreable manner in England.
I think I may venture to say I shall never marry, and even
supposing that possibility and afterwards the possibility of
children; Would this scheme hurt them more than the other?
But I submit it entirely to you. In case this proposal should be
disagreable to you, you have my full consent to the other. Only
give me leave, Dear Sir, to mention one thing. I should be a
monster, If I could distrust either your honor or your goodness
to me; but I am afraid (excuse the freedom) that &OElig;conomy is
not the virtue of our family. A variety of schemes would offer,
old incumbrances would appear, and you yourself would be the
first surprised to find the sum almost sunk to nothing. I should
think that the dividing it might equally suit us both. I should
have a fund for my extraordinary expences, which I should be
the more interested to husband, as I should know that I could
have no pretence to ask for any thing more. You on the other
hand, Dear Sir, would be likewise at a certainty with regard both
to your expences and mine.</p>

<p>I shall end here, Dear Sir; for I am too much agitated to talk
of any thing else: only begging you to excuse the liberty I have
taken. Your goodness has encouraged me to it and I think our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
mutual interest requires it. In case you should approve of my
first proposal, I suppose my going over in the Spring will be
sufficient. Otherwise, I should be glad to hear from you as soon
as possible, that I might set out before winter.</p>

<p>My love and duty are always Mrs. Gibbon's and my sincere
compliments wait upon the Brothers.</p>

<p class="head">
Lausanne, October the 15th, 1763.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir,</span><br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote">WAYS AND MEANS.</div>

<p>Give me leave to begin with the part of my letter which
has given you the most uneasiness, and which is entirely owing to
a mistake. As I have no copy of my letter, I cannot exactly
recollect my expressions, tho' I am perfectly sure of my meaning.
When I mentioned <em>unhappy circumstances</em> I meant only that my
expences, tho' not excessive in themselves, appeared great, and
were in fact more than what the <em>unhappy circumstances</em> of our
estate allowed you to support. That I assure you, Dear Sir, was
my only meaning; if my expression was doubtfull, attribute it
solely to the agitation of spirits I was in when I wrote. When I
reflect on my expences, I do not see, that were I to live last winter
over again at Paris, I could, according to the almost necessary extravagance
of the age, spend less than I have done. I do not pretend
to say that a man of a more exact economy might not have done
sometimes the same things for less money, but I am sure there was
no one blamable or ridiculous expence. Play in particular, Dear
Sir, must have occurred to you, tho' you do not mention it. I
give you <em>my word of honor</em>, that since I have left England I have
not lost twenty pounds.</p>

<p>I will say no more of my scheme, since you disaproove of it.
I own I thought it might have made me very easy without any
additional expence to you. But you do not mention, Dear Sir,
my other proposal supposing we borrowed the five thousand; that
of giving me half of it, and making no addition to my allowance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
whatsoever. Unless you want the whole sum, I should still think
it must be more, or at least as eligible to you as any other. I own
it would be highly agreable to me, to have always a sum of money
lying by me, besides my income; for I do assure you, Sir, that
it is much more a scheme of economy than of expence. I should
employ about seven or eight hundred of it to encrease my annuity
during a year and a half and to enable me to travel agreably. The
remainder I should put into the stocks, and spend only the
interest, reserving the Capital, for any uses that might appear
to both of us worthy of it, for I would promise, Dear Sir, not to
touch any part of it without your knowledge and consent. In
case you want the greatest part of the sum, I should beg at least
that, instead of the two Hundred a year you design adding to my
annuity, you would only add one hundred a year and a thousand
pounds. If the whole is necessary, I am far from contesting it
with you, Dear Sir, but after thanking you for the very handsome
encrease of my annuity, you must give me leave to say that six
hundred pounds a year will not enable me to travel. In this age,
it would be almost impossible for me to do it under 9 or 8 hundred;
every thing is much altered since you were abroad, and I believe
if you consult those who have travelled lately, they would name
scarcely less than a thousand. After the experience I have had,
it would be deceiving both myself and you to talk in another
strain.</p>

<p>I own the thoughts of a mortgage frighten me. The diminution
of the estate, the weight of the interest, the uncertainty of
paying which we have already felt in the old one, give me the
greatest repugnance to encreasing it. Tho' it would hurt me
excessively, I could wish we could avoid it. I would return to
England and wait for a more favorable opportunity. This I
speak merely for myself. If it is necessary to make you easy,
I have nothing more to say.</p>

<p>At all events, Dear Sir, you may depend upon my being in
England a few days before the 30th of December. As I should
be glad to return to this place as soon as the business is over (in
case you still chuse it) I was thinking that so short an apparition
might set the world a talking and guessing at the reasons, and as
it would be better they should know nothing of them, it might be
as well if I came over incognito. I could see you and Mrs. Gibbon
in London, appear very little in publick and go back immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
But as I can hear from you again before my departure, you will
settle every thing as you please.</p>

<p>I am surprised that Mrs. Gibbon has not received the Arquebusade
water I sent her four months ago, tho' I forgot to mention
it.&mdash;A propos upon reflexion, I directed it to Becket and neglected
giving him any directions about it. If you will write a line to
him, I dare say it lies at his shop, near Somerset house in the
Strand. I shall endevour to get you some Lucerne myself,
unless you chuse to stay till next [autumn].</p>

<p>I beg my love and duty to Mrs. Gibbon and sincere compliments
to all friends.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS SIX MONTHS AT LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>I am afraid I have made you wait a little. But let me
tell you without any reproach that I have imitated your example
in proclaiming the arrival of my letter about two months before
it really begins its march. I must acknowledge your letters
deserve waiting for better than mine. However I flatter myself
you are as well pleased with hearing from me as I can be in hearing
from you, and that is saying a great deal.</p>

<p>After having assured you how much I love and respect you,
Dear Madam, which I hope you are convinced of without my
saying it, I should give an account of my method of passing my
time here, but the happiness the most difficult to be described is
perhaps the truest in reality. If I was in a place where I could
fill pages with accounts of balls, reviews, Court assemblies, &amp;c.,
the conclusion would perhaps be only that I had spent a great
deal of time and money with very little genuine satisfaction.
Here every day is an agreable mixture of books and good company,
&amp; consequently every day resembles the day that preceded
it; I have passed six months at Lausanne, but tho' the sum of
my pleasures has been very pleasing I cannot pick out any single
event that I think worthy your attention. You would hardly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
entertained with minute characters of people you are not acquainted
with &amp; will probably never see.</p>

<p>We have some English here; most of them raw boys just
escaped from Eaton. Mr. Guise&mdash;I do not reckon him in the
number of them. He is about my age, has seen a good deal of
the world, &amp; without being a profound scholar is far from wanting
either parts or knowledge. As far as I can judge of him he
seems to be a prudent worthy young man. If I can go into
Italy with him I should like it extremely. Lord Palmerston<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
passed thro' some time ago. He seems to have a very right
notion of travelling and I fancy will make very great improvements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIBBON A MAJOR.</div>

<p>As we have the English papers here, we are by no means
strangers to what passes at home, and many an insignificant piece
of news which we should not have minded in England, gives us
great pleasure at this distance. I was very glad to hear of my
friend Wilkes's deserved chastisement,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and if the law could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
punish him, Mr. Martin could. After all the noise of faction, the
numbers in the first division seem to have shewn that the court
still preserves a very great superiority.</p>

<p>Will you be so good, dear Madam, as to assure my father of
my constant love and duty, and to acquaint him that I have
just drawn a bill of a hundred pounds upon him. I beg my best
compliments to the brothers. I hope poor David has destroyed
his old ennemy the gout. As to Billy [Patton] (do not tell it to
him) I hope he is no longer at Beriton, and that he has got the
better of a enemy still more dangerous&mdash;<em>Laziness</em>.</p>

</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of your letter last saturday, &amp;
found with great satisfaction that you &amp; Mrs. Gibbon were very
well, and that everything went on as usual in our part of the
world. I am very proud of my new dignity,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> tho' I have not
as yet communicated my promotion to my countrymen here.
We have three or four honest regulars in the house with whom I
am in a constant state of war, which I have tolerably maintained
as yet notwithstanding their great superiority of number: I
hope you continue to be well-pleased with our Lord Lieutenant,
and that he is in every thing the reverse of his predecessors.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to you, Dear Sir, for your goodness in
paying the bill I drew upon you in December last, but am sorry
to find you are so much dissatisfied at my expenses, which I
endeavour to moderate as much as I can: keeping up the kind
of figure which you would desire your son should. In case I
leave this place about the end of next month, I am afraid that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
reckoning the several bills I have to pay, the purchase of a chaise,
and some money to carry me on to the next place, I shall want
about two Hundred pounds more, or at least one hundred and
fifty. I am very much concerned I have already drawn for above
half your income, and the more so, as I see no possibility of my
expences being less when I am moving about in Italy. We have
here a young Englishman and his governor, who is a very sensible
sedate man. I have questioned him very much about Italy; he
has assured me that it was not possible for an Englishman to
keep good company in Italy, and to go thro' the country in an
agreable manner, under 800 or at the lowest under 700 pounds
a year. If it was possible for you, Dear Sir, to make such an
effort for <em>only one year</em>, I should consider it as an obligation
which it ought to be my study to repay by the most exact &oelig;conomy
upon all other occasions, and by coming (if necessary) into any
schemes which might be thought of to make us both easy.
But in case you cannot do it, I had rather give up a scheme (I
have indeed always set my heart upon) than it should be the
occasion of perpetual unneasinesses and inconveniences to us both.</p>

<p>Upon reading over what I have wrote, I am afraid, Dear Sir,
you will suspect me of murmuring and being out of humor.
Such sentiments are far from me. I am convinced there is nothing
occasions your complaints but your not being able to support it,
and in that case, tho' I cannot lessen my expence, I can put an
entire stop to it. May I beg, Dear Sir, your speedy directions for
my conduct. If I am to pass the mountains (which I wish and
hope still) I must not wait for the month of April as it is the
very worst in the year.</p>

<p>I beg my love and duty to Mrs. Gibbon. I shall write to
her very soon, though I have little more to say than what I have
just said. My Aunt Porten&mdash;&mdash; Indeed I am much in the wrong,
but I will not be so longer, and I hope very soon to clear score
with all my friends. S<sup>r</sup> Thomas is the only one with whom I
have a C<sup>t</sup> account; creditor indeed in more than one sense of the
word. If he and George Dux, my other creditor, would pay me,
it would be a little help.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LETTERS OF LADY M. W. MONTAGUE.</div>

<p>You are very good to take notice of my owing you a
letter. I am afraid I am too apt to depend upon my friends
knowing me, and upon their being convinced that there is not
the least connection between my regard for them and my putting
pen to paper to assure them of it.</p>

<p>My laziness as to writing is but too natural to me; but no
place is so apt to encourage it as this, where my way of life is so
agreable but at the same time so uniform, that a month or two are
elapsed before I know any thing of the matter. Pleasant weather,
(I am forced to draw the curtain this moment to exclude the sun)
study in the morning, and company in the afternoon. Books
you are not perhaps acquainted with, and people that I am sure
you do not know, make up my occupations, and notwithstanding
all the pleasure I hope for in Italy, I own I shall quit this place
with some unwillingness. My health is very good, only about
two months ago I found my blood thickening, and was forced to
be bled. I have since taken some gentle physick once or twice,
and am now well and in very good spirits.</p>

<p>The only book I have read lately that you can have any
knowledge of, is the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
They have entertained me very much. What fire, what ease,
what knowledge of Europe and of Asia! Her account of the
manners of the Turkish women is indeed different from any thing
we have yet seen. One should have hardly suspected, that a
Turkish husband with his four wives and twenty concubines, is
very far from being absolute.</p>

<p>Will you be so good, Dear Madam, as to excuse the shortness
of this letter. The post is <em>really</em> just going out and I have
barely time to seal it. My love and duty to my father. I have
just drawn a bill for fifty pounds at fifteen days after date.</p>

<p>The reason which has made me defer some time
answering your last obliging letter was our waiting every post
for Mr. Guise's last instructions. As he has never received them,
and we have settled the time of our departure, I take the first
opportunity of laying before you our plan of operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PASSAGE OVER MONT CENIS.</div>

<p>We propose moving from hence next Wednesday the 18th
instant, and passing by Geneva and Mont Cenis to Turin, which we
shall reach in about ten days. After some stay at that place, which
I hope our old camp acquaintance Pitt<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> will make very agreable
to us, we intend going by the Boromean Islands, Milan, Brescia,
Verona, Vicenza, and Padua to Venice, which we must reach by
the 30th of May to be present at the great ceremonies of
Ascension day, where we shall have an opportunity of paying our
court to the Duke of York.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> I hope we shall have seen Venice in
about a fortnight, after which we shall have nothing to prevent
our setting out from thence, passing thro' Ferrara and Bologna
and reaching Florence by the latter end of June. We intend
from thence to retire to Sienne or some other quiet town, and
pass about six weeks in the study of Italian. When we get back
to Florence, that place with Leghorn, Pisa, Luca, &amp;c., will furnish
us ample matter for between two and three months till the latter
end of October, when we propose going to Rome, pushing on
directly to Naples and returning again to Rome the latter end
of November. If we pass there about three months I shall be
ready to come out of Italy the beginning of next March, and hope
to bring back some improvement, as I had pretty well prepared
myself in England, and as I hope I have not lost my time here.
I think I know my fellow-traveller very well, and that knowledge
convinces he is a very sensible good-natured prudent young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish, Dear Sir, I could have followed your Directions, but it
was impossible for me to leave the town after paying all my bills
without Drawing for £200, the remainder of which will barely
carry me to Turin. I shall endeavour during my tour to live
with the most exact æconomy and not to exceed the sum you
have mentioned. I give you my word of honor that neither play
nor women shall form any part of my expence, and I hope
our being two will still contribute to diminish it. I am very
sensible that it is often rather negligence than extravagance
that runs away with my money, and I do assure that I will be as
exact as I can. Consider, Dear Sir, that this is a sacrifice you
make once in my life, and that a hundred pounds now are of
more service to me than three times as much at any other time.</p>

<p>The passage of the mountains is very easy at present, and we
have the advantage of going with a Sardinian officer who is very
well acquainted with the country. As soon as I get to Turin I
shall have the pleasure of writing to you. In the mean time I
beg my compliments to the brothers, and my love and duty to
Mrs. Gibbon, from whom I had a letter the other day.</p>

<p class="head">
Turin, April 28th, 1764.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>After a very tedious journey of nine days from Lausanne,
I got safe to Turin the night before last. The roads thro' Savoy
are very bad, but nothing could surpass the pleasantness of our
passage over Mont Cenis. A very fine day, a most romantick
variety of prospects, and a perfect consciousness that there could
not be the smallest danger. I was carried over the mountain in
a small chair by four men, who relieved each other during about
five leagues. The uphill work was very hard, but upon the
plain, &amp;c., downhill, they went a kind of a trot which I can
only compare to our double time. I am sure you will not blame
me for having added a Guinea to the half crown at which the
King has taxed this hard day's work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon my arrival at Turin, I was much disapointed to find
Mr. Pitt was to set out for England as to-day. I saw him however
yesterday, and nothing could be civiler than he was. He
talked very much of you and of Winchester Camp, and has recommended
me to his Chargé d'Affaires a Mr. Dutems,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> as well
as to the Count de Virry, a Minister of State, for whom likewise
Lord Mountstuart had given me a letter. We are (I believe)
to be presented at Court to-morrow. We shall see some company
and visit the King's palaces and manufactures, but I hardly
think we shall extend our stay here beyond the fortnight we
talked of at first. Every thing follows the example of the Court,
which from one of the most polite in Europe is become bigotted,
gloomy and covetous. Guise and I seem as yet very well satisfied
with each other. Such a society is desirable both as to entertainment
and lessening the expence. As I mentioned in my last
letter that my draught at Lausanne would little more than send
me out of the town, you will not be surprised, Dear Sir, at my
having drawn for £100 here. As near as I can calculate at a
distance, I shall be obliged to take another Hundred at Venice,
two in Tuscany, and three at Rome and Naples as well as to get
out of Italy, which will make up all the 700 which you have
been so good as to mention, &amp; which I am determined if
possible not to exceed, but to watch with as scrupulous an
attention over every expences as your goodness requires of me.
Thus, Dear Sir, you will in the two years and half I may be
abroad, have sacrificed about a thousand pounds extraordinary
to the most agreable part of my life; a sacrifice I shall endeavour
to repay by the behavior of my whole future life.</p>

<p>I propose writing next post to Sir Matthew Fetherston.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Could not I make my peace for my Paris neglect, which is however
excusable by my care and attention to his commands in Italy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>My love and duty attend Mrs. Gibbon and my best compliments
the brothers. I shall not forget the Wax Candles. Shall
I send you any Florence Wine? I fancy we shall move towards
the 10th to be at Venice some time before the 31st, and in
Tuscany towards the end of the month. Our direction will be,
<em>recommended to Mr. Schalkhauser and Hughell at Venice, and to
Mr. Joseph Frescobaldi et fils Bankers at Florence</em>.</p>

<p class="signature">
I am, Dear Sir,<br />
Most truly yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">E. Gibbon</span>.
</p>

<p>I was forced to draw at fifteen days sight; the Banker did not
chuse to give me more and wanted to have had only eight.</p>

<p class="head">
Borromean Islands, May 16th, 1764.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Leger</span>,</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BORROMEAN ISLANDS.</div>

<p>Most certainly, I am a puppy for not having wrote to
you sooner: it is equally certain that you are an ass if you expected
it. *Hurry of running about, time taken up with seeing places,
&amp;c. &amp;c., are excellent excuses; but I fancy you will guess that
my laziness and aversion to writing to my best friend are the
real motive, and I am afraid you will have guessed right.</p>

<p>We are at this minute in a most magnificent palace, in the
middle of a vast lake; Ranging about suites of rooms without
a soul to interrupt us, and secluded from the rest of the universe.
We shall sit down in a moment to supper attended by all the
Count's houshold. This is the fine side of the medal. Turn to
the reverse. We are got here wet to the skin; we have crawled
about fine gardens which rain and fogs prevented our seeing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and if to-morrow does not hold up a little better, we shall be in
some doubt whether we can say we have seen these famous islands.
Guise says yes, and I say no. The Count is not here; we have
our supper from a paultry hedge alehouse, (excuse the bull,) and
the Servants have offered us beds in the palace, pursuant to their
master's directions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIFE AT TURIN.</div>

<p>I hardly think you will like Turin; the Court is old &amp; dull;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
and in that country every one follows the example of the court.
The principal amusement seems to be driving about in Your
Coach in the evening &amp; bowing to the people you meet. If you
go when the royal family is there, you have the additional pleasure
of stopping to salute them every time they pass. I had that
advantage fifteen times one afternoon. We were presented to a
Lady who keeps a public assembly, and a very mournfull one it
is. The few women that go to it are each taken up by their
Cicisbeo; and a poor Englishman, who can neither talk Piedmontese
nor play at Faro, stands by himself, without one of their
haughty nobility doing him the honor of speaking to him. You
must not attribute this account to our not having staid long
enough to form connections. It is a general complaint of our
countrymen, except of Lord Berkely, who has been engaged for
about two years in the service of a Lady, whose long nose is her
most distinguishing fine feature.</p>

<p>The most sociable women I have met with are the King's
daughters. I chatted for about a quarter of an hour with them,
talked about Lausanne, and grew so very free and easy, that I
drew my snuf-box,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> rapped it, took snuff twice (a Crime never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
known before in the presence-chamber,) &amp; continued my discourse
in my usual attitude of my body bent forwards, and my fore
finger stretched out. As it might however have been difficult
to keep up this acquaintance, I chiefly employ my time in seeing
places, which fully repaid me in pleasure the trouble of my
journey. What entertained me the most, was the Museum and
the Citadel. The first is under the care of a M. Bartoli, who
received us without any introduction, in the politest manner
in the world, and was of the greatest service to us, as I dare
say he will be to you. The Citadel is a stupendous work; &amp;
when you have seen the suterraneous part of it, you will scarcely
think it possible such a place can ever be taken. As it is
however a regular one, it does not pique my curiosity so much
as those irregular fortifications hewn out of the Alps, such as
Exiles, Fenestrelles, &amp; the Brunette<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> would have done, could
we have spared the time necessary.* The last of these places you
may see.</p>

<p>I mentioned you to M. Dutems, Chargé des Affaires de sa
Majestè Brittanique, in Pitt's absence. He cannot send you
so unlimited a permission as you wanted, but if you will write
to him some days before you set out, specifying the time you
shall pass, &amp; the names of the peoples to be inserted, he will
take care to have one sent to Suze.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENOA.</div>

<p>*Our next stage from Turin has been Milan, where we were
mere Spectators, as it was not worth while to endeavour at
forming connection for so very few days. I think you will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
surprised at the great Church, but infinitely more so at the
regiment of Baden-Baden, which is in the Citadel. Such
steadiness, such alertness in the men, &amp; such exactness in the
officers, as passed all my expectations. Next Friday I shall
see the Regiment reviewed by General Serbelloni. Perhaps I
may write a particular letter about it. From Milan we proceed
to Genoa, &amp; from thence to Florence. You stare&mdash;But really
we find it so inconvenient to travel like mutes, and to lose
a number of curious things for want of being able to assist
our eyes with our tongues, that we have resumed our original
plan, and leave Venice for next year. I think I should advise
you to do the same.*</p>


<p class="head">
Milan, May 18th, 1764.
</p>

<p>*The next morning was not fair, but however we were able to
take a view of the islands, which, by the help of some imagination,
we conclude to be a very delightfull though not an enchanted
place. I would certainly advise you to go there from Milan,
which you may very well perform in a day and half. Upon our
return, we found Lord Tilney<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and some other English in their
way to Venice. We heard a melancholy piece of news from
them; Byng<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> died at Bologna a few days ago of a feaver. I am
sure you will all be very sorry to hear it.</p>

<p>We expect a volume of news from you in relation to Lausanne,
and in particular to the alliance of the Dutchess with the frogs.
Is it already concluded? How does the Bride look after her
great revolution? Pray embrace her and the adorable, if you can,
in both our names; and assure them, as well as all the spring,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
that we talk of them very often, but particularly of a Sunday;
and that we are so disconsolate, that we have neither of us commenced
Cicisbeos as yet, whatever we may do at Florence. We
have drank the Dutchess's health, not forgetting the little woman<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
on the top of Mont Cenis, in the middle of the Lago Maggiore,
&amp;c. &amp;c. I expect some account of the said little woman. Whether
she talks &mdash;&mdash; as much as usual and who is my successor? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
think Montagny had begun to supplant me before I went.* Salute
all our friends in both our names. The Count, the Queen's
own, Buch Tysen, The foot Guards &amp; the Oxford stage (&amp; Mr.
George Hyde Clarke). I am sorry to hear from Grand, that the
last was ill. I heard likewise that your military list was augmented
by a Hanoverian: I dare say the canonading of <em>Amenebourg</em> has
often been fought over. As to people of the town, embrace
Grand, Pavillard, and the Mesery, make some Compliments to a
great many more, and don't forget to kick Constant &amp; Dittermanches
before you come away. *I expect your answer at
Florence, and your person at Rome; which the Lord* of his
infinite mercy *grant. Amen.*</p>

<h3><em>To his Father.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Genoa, June the 4th, 1764.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>I dare say you will be surprised when you see the date
of my letter, as according to my last from Turin, you must have
imagined me at Venice. It was indeed our intention till we got
as far as Milan, and saw the shoals of English that were pouring
in from every side, and till we heard the same accounts from
everybody of the crowds and dearness at Venice upon this
occasion. Garrets hired as a great favor at four sequins a night,
every thing else in proportion, and with regard to us, who could
not have got there above two days before Ascension day, the
greatest danger of lying in the street. A fortnight passed at
Venice at this time would have occasioned a very considerable
augmentation in my expences, greater I am afraid than would
have suited you, and which I should have brought upon you
merely for the sake of a ceremony, as I can take Venice in as
convenient, and a much cheaper manner in coming home. I
was happy enough to find Mr. Guise entirely of my opinion, &amp;
we both agreed to strike off to Genoa &amp; from thence by the way
of Leghorn into Tuscany. I can easily conceive how extravagant
Venice would have been upon such an occasion, from what I have
already experienced of the dearness of travelling in Italy. Upon
the road the necessary expences of the posts, &amp;c., are higher than
in England, and with regard to the inns, the instant they discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
you are an Englishman, they do not know what to ask. We are
constantly obliged to reduce their demands to one half, and even
then to pay them too much. At Pavie I remember they asked us
about twelve shillings for our lodging two nights in a single
room. We gave them about eight, which they took after about
half an hour's wrangling.</p>

<p>This, Dear Sir, is the disagreable side of travelling. In every
other respect my tour exceeds my most sanguine expectations,
altho' I am not yet got to the most interesting part of Italy.
Turin, Milan, and Genoa have afforded me very great entertainement,
and very different scenes. You cannot expect, Dear Sir,
an account of any one of them. The whole it would be impossible
to give you, and I should hardly know what particulars to select.
We had better reserve them till we meet at Beriton, where the
history of my peregrinations may perhaps furnish out the amusement
of some evening when there is no post. Indeed if negligence
and conciseness can be ever excused in a Correspondent they
ought to be in a traveller. The common excuse of having no
time is almost verified. Your morning is taken up with running
about to see places, your evenings are commonly engaged in
company, and you are forced to employ the very few moments
you have at home in setting down some account of the things
you have seen.</p>

<p>But amongst all my avocations I cannot help mentioning Mr.
&amp; Mrs. Celesia, who have received us not only in the most polite
but really in the most friendly manner. We have dined and
supped several times with them; once at their Country house
which is still wilder than Beriton, and they have introduced us
to the Doge and to several houses in the town. This afternoon
we are going with them upon a party in the country. Mrs.
Celesia seems to retain the warmest friendship for Mrs. Gibbon;
she is very sorry their correspondence has been dropt, and has
some thoughts of renewing it herself. I likewise saw the other
day Captain John Elliot,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> who came in with his Frigate and sailed
again in about a couple of hours for Minorca. He has been a
great while beating about the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Mr. Guise and I travel in great harmony and good humour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
He is indeed a very worthy sensible man, and I hope I have
formed a friendship that will last as long as my life. He is very
far from being ignorant &amp; will be more so every day, as he has a
very proper spirit of curiosity and enquiry. My inferior companion
(my servant) is a very useful one in this country, and in
general a very good one. I never enjoyed a better state of
health, and hope I shall stand the heats of Florence pretty well.
I fancy I shall be obliged to draw again soon after my arrival
there, which will be in about ten days. I hope I need say nothing
of my sentiments which are always the same for Mrs. Gibbon. I
hope to write to her from Florence. My sincere compliments
wait upon the brothers.</p>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Florence, June 20th, 1764.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLORENCE.</div>

<p>Without any of those common apologies for not writing
which are generally made use of to fill up the first half page of a
letter, I shall tell you at once that I am got here safe and in
perfect health, tho' somewhat later than I intended. We proposed
going by sea from Genoa to Leghorn. We had taken a Felucca,
and were to have embarked the 7th, but a strong south-west wind
springing up the day before, made it impossible for any vessel to
stir out of the harbour, and kept us waiting six days a most disagreable
state of anxiety and attendance. At last, seeing no
likelyhood of any alteration in the wind, we were forced to set out
by land, and to come round thro' Parma, Modena and Bologna.
As we stopt to see what was worthy our notice upon the road,
(excepting only Bologna, which will require a fortnight or three
weeks) we got here only last night, and are settled in an excellent
good <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hôtel garni</i> kept by one Charles, an Englishman, whom the
Duke of Richmond is very well acquainted with as well as with
our footman Valentin (for we only take one between us), to whom
he has given an exceeding good character in writing.</p>

<p>Every step I take in Italy, I am more and more sensible of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the obligation I have to my father in allowing me to undertake
the tour. Indeed, Dear Madam, this tour is one of the very few
things that exceed the most sanguine and flattering hopes. I
do not pretend to say that there are no disagreable things in
it: bad roads, and indifferent inns, taking very often a good
deal of trouble to see things which do not deserve it, and
especially the continual converse one is obliged to have with
the vilest part of mankind&mdash;innkeepers, post-masters and custom
house officers, who impose upon you without any possibility
of preventing it,&mdash;all these are far from being pleasing. But
how amply is a traveller repaid for those little mortifications
by the pleasure and knowledge he finds in almost every place.
The actual beauties are always the very great singularity of the
country, the different pieces of antiquity either dispersed or
collected into cabinets, and the variety of master-pieces of
sculpture and painting have already made me pass some of the
most entertaining days I have yet known, and I have before
me the pleasing reflexion that what I have yet seen is far inferior
to what I shall find in this place as well as Rome and Naples. I
flatter myself, that the works of the greatest artists, which I have
continually before my eyes, have already begun to form my taste
for the fine arts. I shall however endeavour not to become a
Coxcomb, nor to take the knowledge of a few terms for real
science. I shall perhaps bring back to England an unafected
taste for those arts, I am afraid without the judgment of a connoisseur,
and I hope without the ridiculous part of that character.</p>

<p>I have never lost sight of the undertaking I laid the foundations
of at Lausanne, and I do not despair of being able one day to produce
something by way of a Description of ancient Italy, which
may be of some use to the publick, and of some credit to myself.
At least I know that I have already collected a considerable stock
of materials which is daily encreasing, and that from reading and
travel I have made a number of observations which will enter, very
properly enter, into such a work, and which will have at least the
merit of novelty. You will excuse me, Dear Madam, from entering
into particulars as to any part of what I have seen; the task
would be endless, and I must employ in giving you a very imperfect
account a time of which I want almost every instant. But as my
memory is pretty good, and as I keep a very exact journal;
the recollection of this part of my life may be no disagreable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
employment of some winter evenings at Beriton. I am going to
take an Italian master, and shall endeavour to get as much out
of him as I can during my stay here, which Mr. Guise and I
seemed to have fixed at about two months.</p>

<p>We have several English here. Lord Exeter, whom we shall
hardly see, as he sets out after dinner; Mr. Ponsonby,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> son to the
Irish speaker, a very agreable young man whom we knew at
Turin; Mr. Littleton, son to Lord Littleton,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> &amp;c. Some more
whom I have not yet seen. We make our first visit after dinner
to Sir Horatio Mann,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> who happens to be a distant relation of Mr.
Guise. Indeed without that advantage his general behavior to
the English assures of the politest reception and an introduction
into the best company in town. From the universal character of
Florence I expect to meet with a very agreable society. I hope
we shall avoid the fate of Lord Fordwich<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> (whom I forgot to
mention). The charms of a superannuated beauty have captivated
him to such a degree as to make him totally forget his country, and
to fix him at Florence these five or six years without the least prospect
of his ever leaving it. The Duke of York is expected here
to-night from Venice in his way to Leghorn, from whence he goes
by sea to Marseilles and so to Paris. It is said he will finish his
travels by a visit to his sister at Brunswick.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> I suppose we must
be all presented to him.</p>

<p>I was much disapointed to find no letters from England, and
especially from my father; as I had wrote to the banker at Venice
to send all that might come to Florence. I hope none on either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
side have miscarried. I wrote upon leaving Lausanne, as well as
from Turin and Genoa. I shall be obliged to draw immediately for
a hundred pounds; and as far as I can foresee my expences I hope
I shall keep within my bounds. I am very sensible of the times
I may have launched out a little too much, but I can safely say,
that were I to perform the journey I have already I could not do
it for a Guinea less. I have made some progress in the arts of
æconomy and exactness, but those of the Italians are necessarily
superior to mine. Will it be necessary, Dear Madam, to repeat
any assurances of those sentimens which duty and inclination have
an equal share in?</p>

<p class="signature">
I am, Dear Madam,<br />
Most truly yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">E. Gibbon</span>.
</p>

<p>I shall not forget the wax candles. I shall send with them a
small quantity of Florence wine.</p>

<h3><em>To his Father.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Rome, October the 9th, 1764.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROME.</div>

<p>We set out from Florence last Saturday sevenight and
are arrived here after a journey of about ten days. We came
round by Lucca, Pisa, Leghorn and Sienna, and I think made a
very agreable tour of it. I must acknowledge that I had the
least pleasure in what my companion enjoyed I believe the most;
the Opera of Lucca. That little republick, who could give usefull
lessons of gouvernment to many states much more considerable,
lays out a very large sum of money every autumn in entertaining
an exceeding good Opera at the time that public entertainements
are very dead in the other towns of Italy, and receives their
money again with very good interest from the great affluence of
strangers who resort to Lucca upon that occasion. Of the
different tastes which a man may form or indulge in in Italy that
of musick has hitherto been lost upon me, and I have always had
the honesty never to pretend to any taste which I was in reality
devoid of.</p>

<p>We past four days at Leghorn where I saw the Actons.
They were so civil to me that I was much embarassed how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
behave. The poor old Commodore is in a most melancholy
situation. Last winter he had a most violent attack of the
Apoplexy; whilst in that situation he was persuaded either from
motives of interest or devotion to change his religion in which he
had been till then very steady. The immediate consequence of
which imprudent step was the total neglect of all his English
friends, who from being very intimate with him have taken the
unanimous resolution of not holding the smallest connection with
him. I most sincerely pity him. At his time of life, to lose the
only friends he had, (for he has never been able even to learn the
language of the country) to be continually regretting England
which he will never see again, and to find himself oppressed with
every misfortune of age and infirmity, is a situation truly melancholy.
He talked to me a great deal of you and of times which I
had scarce any remembrance of, and I think from his manner and
conversation that I never saw a more lively picture of an unhappy
man. I thought it right to acquaint the English at Leghorn of
my reasons for not neglecting him as they did, and they all seemed
to approve of my behavior.</p>

<p>I am now, Dear Sir, at Rome. If it was difficult before to
give you or Mrs. Gibbon any account of what I saw, it is impossible
here. I have already found such a fund of entertainement
for a mind somewhat prepared for it by an acquaintance with the
Romans, that I am really almost in a dream. Whatever ideas
books may have given us of the greatness of that people, their
accounts of the most flourishing state of Rome fall infinitely short
of the picture of its ruins. I am convinced there never never
existed such a nation, and I hope for the happiness of mankind
there never will again. I was this morning upon the top of
Trajan's pillar. I shall not attempt a description of it. Only
figure to yourself a column 140 feet high of the purest white
marble, composed only of about 30 blocks and wrought into bas-reliefs
with as much taste and delicacy as any chimney piece at
Up-park.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The sickness of Naples seems pretty well over. I shall not
however yet venture to it. The concern you and Mrs. Gibbon
express in her last letter, makes it my duty to avoid the appearance
as well as the reality of danger. If I allow about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
months to Rome, a month to Naples, and a fortnight or three
weeks to the road, &amp;c., visiting again some of the most curious
things upon my return, I shall have but few idle moments, and yet
shall hardly be able to take my last leave of Rome before the end
of February. About six weeks may do for Bologna, Verona, &amp;c.,
and Venice, and towards the middle or end of April I hope to
have finished a tour attended with the greatest pleasure, and I
flatter myself with some improvement. I shall then be ready,
Dear Sir, to obey your orders with regard to the time and manner
of my returning to England. The grand tour of Germany I do
not even think of, as I am sensible of the considerable and unavoidable
expence it would be attended with. The route thro'
Bavaria to the Rhine and Low Countries, or that of the south of
France to the same parts, would have their several advantages and
might each employ about two months. However from the great
extent of country I must pass thro' so rapidly, they would not be
without an addition of expence. Believe me, Dear Sir, that is
a consideration I feel so often and so sensibly; that rather than
any thing should disturb the pleasure of our meeting, I will come
down from Venice to Leghorn and embark for England. Satisfied
with the enjoyment of Italy and France, I will rather reflect upon
what I shall have seen than upon what I shall have lost. I wait,
Dear Sir, for your directions. I have asked for them rather soon,
both to unburthen my mind, and because we are neither of us
the most exact Correspondents. I have a hundred more things
to say. I would thank Mrs. Gibbon for the agreable news she sent
me in her last letter of your having entirely got over your late
indisposition, but my paper is out and I can only add that I am
and ever shall be,</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONEY TROUBLES.</div>

<p>I received last Wednesday your letter of the 16th of
October, and could scarcely have thought that any one from you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
could give me so much uneasiness as this has done. I have let
slip one post in order to consider it with more attention, and I
believe I must visit again every thing I have seen, or seemed to
see, in the intermediate days. I must own, Dear Sir, that I am
frightened both when I look back, and when I look forwards. A
mortgage of £10,000 contracted about six years ago, £1200 taken
out of Hervey's hands; and now an urgent necessity of selling
one of our very best estates! Where must this end? Believe
me, Dear Sir, I am very far from meaning the smallest reproach.
I am convinced that all these measures have been dictated by
necessity, and that this necessity has been occasioned by the
intricacy of affairs, the iniquity of men, and a variety of accidents
over which prudence has no power. But this very conviction
encreases my uneasiness. What may be one day my fate without
half your knowledge of business, and deprived of all those
ressources which you must have found in living so many years in
the Country, and in managing and improving your estate? With
less æconomy and perhaps more wants, I may very easily find my
way to a Gaol.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, Dear Sir, I am very sensible of the
unhappy difficulties of Otway's affair, and both duty and inclination
would engage me to submit to every thing in order to
extricate you from it. But for a sum which is not very considerable,
will it be necessary to sell an Estate which I have heard
you often speak of as the clearest and most valuable you are in
possession of? If it is absolutely necessary to sell something,
would it not be better to endeavour to part with Putney? I
speak, Dear Sir, very much at random for want of knowing the
respective values of the Estates, and what you are offered for
Lenborough.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Indeed without some such knowledge I can
scarcely say anything positive upon the subject; more than that,
if you still persist in that scheme, it would be very difficult for me
to dispute any thing that you think expedient, or conducive to
your own ease and happiness.</p>

<p>But in that case, Dear Sir, should you think the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
conditions unreasonable?&mdash;1st. That upon the sale of the estate,
after discharging the mortgage and deducting £1200 for Otway's
affair, the residue of the money should be paid into a banker's
hands and be lodged in the funds in our joint names. The
interests should be solely yours, and we should have what we
have so often desired, a sum of money ready for any emergency,
and sufficient to execute any plan, either of bringing me into
Parliament, or any thing else. Surely, Dear Sir, this scheme is
preferable to purchasing more land. Have not we enough
already? The only thing that hurts me in this proposal is the
air of distrust it seems to carry with it. Believe me, Dear Sir,
when I say that I can as little doubt of your care and regard for
me as of my own, and that if I take any precautions, they are
such only, as I should think it equally prudent to take against
myself. My other condition would be the same which I
mentioned last year, that of changing my annuity into a rent
charge upon the estate, and permitting me to convert that into
another annuity which I apprehend would be at least double
what I at present enjoy. I have often considered it coolly since
that time, and a scheme which would make me easy and happy
for life, appears to me much more eligible than any other which
would make a small addition to my income at your expence.
Marriage, and the consideration of posterity would be the only
motives which could ever make me repent of such a step, and
against these my circumstances, my constitution and a way of
thinking grounded upon reasoning and strengthened by experience
and habit, will I hope effectually secure me. My views will
never extend beyond the happiness of your life, that of Mrs.
Gibbon's and of my own. Let us mutually consult what may the
most contribute towards that object without calculating what
estate may at last remain <em>for the Elliots</em>.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>I hope you will excuse, Dear Sir, the warmth [with] which I
have expressed myself on a subject so highly interesting to us both.
I am sure I have not wrote a line that has not been dictated by
those sentiments of respect, duty and gratitude upon which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
have so many claims, and which will always engage to place your
ease and happiness upon a level with my own. I shall wait your
order as to the time and manner of my coming home; but I hope
you will not insist upon it's being before the month of June.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS CREDIT WITHDRAWN.</div>

<p>This moment to my great surprize, Barazzi, the banker
of Rome, sent for me to shew me a letter he had just received
from the banker at Lausanne, who had given me my general
credit all over Italy, to recall that credit and to desire he would
give me no more money. This can be only owing to the last
draught from Florence having been protested, and as the banker
has probably sent the same advice to his other correspondents, my
character is ruined in every great town in Italy, and what makes
it more unfortunate is the draught I gave from hence about a
week ago for £100 more at twenty days' sight; which will probably
have the same fate. I feel my situation the more as I am
not conscious of having deserved it by distressing you with
extravagant draughts. After a mature deliberation you fixed
upon 700 pounds for my tour of Italy. I have always advised
you regularly before I drew, and I have never, Dear Sir, exceeded
my proportion of the sum. To what then am I to attribute this
unforeseen misfortune? In your last letter you say nothing, and
yet you must have then received mine from Florence. Forgive
my warmth, Dear Sir, I scarce know what to think, write, or do.</p>

<p>I shall wait with the utmost impatience for an answer. Indeed
I shall be very uneasy till it comes. Barazzi, who was very
civil upon the occasion, desires if you send me credit upon any
other banker (which will be absolutely necessary) that you would
apply to Andrew Drummond whom he corresponds with. Till
then it will be impossible for me to stir from Rome, or to live
with much pleasure in it, while I know there are people who may
very naturally suspect me of being a rogue or an adventurer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>

writes, and believe me ever</p>

<p>Since I sent my letter, which is already sealed up in

will be necessary to send me must be given by the London Banker
upon the other towns I am to go to, as well as upon Rome; at
least upon Naples, Bologna, Venice, and one or two principal
places in France or Germany according as you intend I should
come home. After so unfortunate an accident I can scarce hope
Barazzi himself will give me any credit elsewhere; and I must be
the more exact, as in several of those places I shall find the bankers
prepossessed against me by the letter of the Lausanne banker
which must have been circular. How can it have happened, Dear
Sir, that a letter can have had the time to go from London to
Florence, from Florence to Lausanne, and from Lausanne to Rome
without my having had the smallest intimation of it from you?</p>

Naples, January the 29th, 1765.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,<br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPLES.</div>

<p>I am very sorry for the reason (it is really no excuse)
which I have had for my late dilatoriness in writing. I have
waited with great impatience for an answer to the letters I had
wrote my father, have always hoped and imagined that I could
scarce fail of receiving it the very next post, and living in that daily
expectation have suffered several posts to elapse without writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
myself. Indeed I begin to fear that some letters must have miscarried.
I hope however to hear from my father very soon, since
if I should return to Rome without having had any orders from
him as to the time and manner of my returning home, I should
find myself very much embarassed how to act.</p>

<p>We arrived here only last night, so that as yet I have seen
nothing; not even the glorious prospect of the bay of Naples. A
thick foggy cloudy day (for such weather have we sometimes even
in this happy climate) hangs over it, and veils all its beauties.
The journey from Rome has satisfied at least one species of a
disagreable curiosity, that of being acquainted with the very worst
roads in the universe. You are sometimes sunk in sloughs and
sometimes racked and battered on the broken remains of the old
Appian way, and when after a tedious day you at last arrive at the
long desired inn, you soon wish for the moment of setting out
again. Governor Ellis<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> who is here, a man famous for attempting
the North West passage, and consequently acquainted with every
species of hardship, declares that he had rather circumnavigate the
Globe, than go from Rome to Naples. This single circumstance
may convince you, Dear Madam, how just are the common but
melancholy observations, of the wretched state of this fine country
and of the misery of its idle and oppressed inhabitants. They are
indeed painted in too lively colours to escape the notice of the
most inatentive traveller, and so shocking as to excite the pity of
the least feeling one. I will not repeat here, Dear Madam, my old
and lazy maxim of saying little because I have a great deal to say,
and of reserving every thing for your dressing Room. I assure
you without flattery, that I am very impatient to see it. I cannot
say whether you will find me improved in any thing else, but
at least I think I am become a better Englishman, and that, without
adopting the honest prejudices of a Hampshire farmer, I am
reconciled to my own country, that I see many of its advantages
better than I did, and that a more enlarged view has corrected
many errors of my premature and partial observation.</p>

<p>We are at present in the midst of a most brilliant carnaval,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and shall scarce be able to breath between balls, operas, Assemblies
and dinners. I have not yet seen Mr. Hamilton our Minister,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> but
he is extremely liked by the English here, of whom most are our
Roman or Florentine acquaintance. Our only Peer is Lord
Berkely, with whom we are just going to dine. I imagine we
shall be presented to the boy King next Sunday. It must be a
most ridiculous farce of Majesty.</p>

<p>Will you be so good as to acquaint my father that I drew for
£100 at twenty days' sight the morning I left Rome, and that not
having time to write by that post I acquainted Mr. Darrel with it
by a letter of four lines.</p>

<p>How superfluous is it, Dear Madam, to repeat my protestations
of duty and affection to my father, of tenderness to yourself, or
of real friendship, and my best wishes for your brothers.</p>

<p>We are at last going to quit Rome, and altho' every
reason for not writing much or often looks suspicious from an old
offender like me, yet at present a laudable avarice of time makes
me regret every moment I am not rambling about a place I am so
soon to take my leave of.</p>

<p>I shall be obliged to draw (at as long a sight as I can) for two
hundred pounds: not that I have run into any new expences I
did not foresee before, but merely from a prudence which I think
a proper one in the very nice situation into which the Florence
affair has thrown me. I am sure I can have the money from
Barazzi here, as Grand has renewed my credit upon him, but tho'
I hope and believe he has done it equally upon the other Bankers,
I am not at all sure of it, and might find myself exposed to the
refusal of the banker at Venice, and without any acquaintance
there who could vouch for my character and circumstances. As I
hope to carry away a good £150 I am at least sure of getting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Genoa, where I have some previous knowledge of the banker, and
where in case of any difficulty I could call on Celesia. I hope this
precaution, which appeared to me in the light of a necessary one,
will not be inconvenient to you. It shall make no alteration in
the plan I laid down in my letters from Naples, and you may
depend upon it, Dear Sir, that neither in point of time nor of
money I will any ways exceed it.</p>

<p>I can scarce hope to receive any more letters from you, which
reduces me to the necessity of chusing for myself. I shall however
write to you, Dear Sir, from Bologna, Genoa, and one or
two places in France to acquaint you with my motions till I have

</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISAPPOINTMENT WITH VENICE.</div>

<p>Your last letter which I received only at Bologna was
a most pleasing renewal of a correspondence, which (somehow or
another) had been a little interrupted, but which I shall always
consider as both usefull and agreable to me, since I am sure of
finding in all your letters the tenderness of a mother, the sincerity
of a friend and the entertainement of a most knowing correspondent.
I am indeed but too unworthy of such a commerce.</p>

<p>Of all the towns in Italy, I am the least satisfied with Venice;
objects which are only singular without being pleasing produce
a momentary surprize which soon gives way to satiety and
disgust. Old and in general ill built houses, ruined pictures, and
stinking ditches dignified with the pompous denomination of
canals, a fine bridge spoilt by two Rows of houses upon it, and a
large square decorated with the worst Architecture I ever yet
saw, and wonderfull only in a place where there is more land
than water: such are the colours I should employ in my portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of Venice; a portrait certainly true in general, tho' perhaps you
should attribute the very great darkness of the shades to my being
out of humour with the place. Here are no English, and all
communication with the natives of the place is strictly forbid.
Our chief ressource is our Resident Mr. Murray,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> an honest plain
man, and a very good companion, who gives us most excellent
dinners every other day.</p>

<p>I found here that my prudence in taking up a larger sum of
money at Rome than I immediately wanted, was very far from
being a vain precaution. I found this Banker a sour, suspicious
old fellow, who began by vexing me very much in talking of my
letters having been protested in presence of Guise, to whom I had
never mentioned it. Indeed the Brute did it in so very abrupt
a way that it seemed his chief design was to mortify me. Upon
my mentioning that I believed the Lausanne banker had restored
my credit, he began to make a number of difficulties, which I at
last cut short by telling him that I neither wanted his money nor
his company. It was very lucky I had it in my power to talk in
that manner.</p>

<p>The part of your letter, Dear Madam, which related to my
being at home in May made me a little uneasy. My father hinted
something of that kind in a former letter. I am sorry that your's
is wrote before the reception of my answer, as I should then know
whether my father still expected my return so soon. It would
be most highly inconvenient to me. I could indeed, going
directly from hence, arrive in England by the end, and the end
only, of May. But in order to do it, I must go the very straitest
road, never stop, and give up a number of curious things which
will scarce ever be within my reach again! Cannot the meeting
be put off till September? Cannot Sir Thomas<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> protract his stay
one month longer? Will my missing one more meeting hurt the
Battalion very sensibly? I am forced to ask all these questions
without being able to wait for their answers. I must here at
once determine for myself and I am afraid of determining wrong.
I could have wished, my father would have explained himself
more clearly, whether he thought my return in May, a thing
absolutely necessary and right, and am almost inclined to imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that he would have done so, if he had looked upon it in that
light. I have still some hopes of receiving his answer to my
letter from Naples, which I should immediately obey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLANS FOR HIS RETURN.</div>

<p>You may see, Dear Madam, in what a state of perplexity I am,
and that I am not really yet determined what to say or what to
do. However the prospect of my tour thro' the South of France
(which will only delay my return about a month or six weeks) is
so pleasing, and the means of obviating any inconveniences in the
Battalion appear so easy, that I cannot help taking a resolution
which I hope will not displease my father. I leave this place in
a day or two and shall be at Turin about the beginning of May;
from thence I shall proceed to Lyons, go down the Rhone to
Avignon and wheel round by Provence and Languedoc to
Bordeaux, where I shall easily find a ship bound for London. I
have made this alteration, as it enlarges my tour, without making
any difference either in time or expence. I shall only draw for
another hundred, and my father may depend upon my being at
Beriton by the end of June or the beginning of July; barring
accidents of wind and weather. With what pleasure, Dear
Madam, shall we meet. I assure you I have not forgot the Wax
Candles. Venice is the place for them, but, as far as I can learn,
tho' whiter they do not burn so well as ours. I cannot make out
whether in point of price it is worth sending them.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>After a pretty troublesome passage of Mount Cenis we
are at last arrived here. I say at last, for it is at least a fortnight
later than we expected, occasioned by several inevitable hinderances.
Upon casting up as well as I could my accounts of time
and money, I soon found how impossible it would be for me to
execute my tour of the south of France within the limitations of
both which I had proposed. I mean to execute it with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
degree of pleasure or profit, to stay long enough in any place to
be acquainted with the inhabitants, and not to hurt my health
perhaps by travelling too quick in a very hot season and country.
Perhaps, Dear Sir, if I had had time to have consulted you, you
might have indulged me a little longer; but it was an indulgence
I was determined not to grant myself at the expence of the
promise I had made you of being in England by the end of June
or beginning of July. The only way I have of keeping my word
is going from hence to England by the way of Paris, where I
shall stay a few days. I have drawn from hence £100 at eight
days' sight (which term was forced upon me). When I consider
that my last draught from Rome was about the middle of March,
I cannot think I have been extravagant in spending about £150
in ten weeks and a journey of above 700 miles. I own that
when I consider I have only seen Paris and Italy in two years
and a half, I am displeased with myself for having staid so long
at Lausanne. Had I set out for Italy the autumn before, I might
have passed last winter in the south of France, and yet been at
home in the spring; but it is easier to condemn than to repair
past faults. Perhaps one day you may spare me, Dear Sir, some
months to compleat what I have left unfinished at present&mdash;But
my duty is now to set down contented at Beriton with you and
Mrs. Gibbon, and I can assure you that never was duty more
agreable to inclination.</p>

<p>At Suze at the very foot of the Alps I met Sir Thomas
Worsley and family. We supped together and talked over
national, provincial, and regimental affairs. He is just the same
as he was; only not so great a courtier. He seems much pleased
with his intended scheme. I think it a very bad one. Naples
has no advantage, but those of climate and situation; and in
point of expence and education for his children is the very last
place in Italy I should have advised. Indeed I should have
thought that the south of France would have suited him much
better.</p>

<p>I shall write once more from Paris: till when, Dear Sir,
believe me</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Leger</span>,

<div class="sidenote">REGRET AT MISSING BERLIN.</div>

<p>*Why I did not leave a letter for you at Marseilles? For
a very plain reason: Because I did not go to Marseilles. But,
as you have most judiciously added, why did not I send one?
Humph! I own that nonplusses me a little. However, hearken
to my history. After revolving a variety of plans, and suiting
them as well as possible to time and finances, Guise and I at last
agreed to pass from Venice to Lyons, swim down the Rhosne,
wheel round the South of France, and embark at Bourdeaux.
Alas! At Lyons I received letters which convinced me that I
ought no longer to deprive my country of one of her greatest
ornaments. Unwillingly I obeyed, left Guise to execute alone the
remainder of our plan, passed about ten delicious days at Paris,
and arrived in England about the end of June. Guise followed
me about two months afterwards, as I was informed by an
epistle from him, which, to his great astonishment, I immediately
answered. You perceive there is still some virtue amongst men.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exempli gratiâ</i>, your letter is dated Vienna, October 12th, 1765;
it made its appearance at Beriton, Wednesday evening, October
the 29th. I am at this present writing, sitting in my library, on
Thursday morning, between the hours of twelve &amp; one.</p>

<p>I have ventured to suppose you still at Berlin; if not, I presume
you take care that your letters should follow you. This
Ideal march to Berlin is the only one I can make at present. I
am under command; and were I to talk of a third sally as yet, I
know some certain people who would think it just as ridiculous
as the third sally of the Renowned Don Quixote. All I ever hoped
for was, to be able to take the field once more, after lying quiet
a couple of years. I must own that your executing your tour in
so compleat a manner gives me a little selfish pain. If I make a
summer's escape to Berlin, I cannot hope for the companion I
flattered myself with. I am sorry however I have said so much;
but as it is difficult to increase your honour's proper notions of
your own perfections, I will e'en let it stand. Indeed I owed you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
something for Your account of the favourable reception my book<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
has met with. I see there are people of taste at Vienna, and no
longer wonder at your liking it. Since the court is so agreeable,
a thorough reformation must have taken place. The stiffness of
the Austrian Etiquette, and the haughty magnificence of the Hungarian
princes, must have given way to more civilized notions.
You have (no doubt) informed yourself of the forces and revenues
of the Empress. I think (however unfashionably) we always
esteemed her. Have You lost or improved that opinion? Princes,
like Pictures, to be admired, must be seen in their proper point of
view, which is often a pretty distant one. I am afraid you will
find it peculiarly so at Berlin.</p>

<p>I need not desire you to pay a most minute attention to the
Austrian and Prussian discipline. You have been bit by a mad
Serjeant as well as myself; and when we meet, we shall run over
with every particular which we can approve of, blame, or imitate.
Since my arrival, I have assumed the august character of Major,
received returns, issued orders, &amp;c. &amp;c. I do not intend you
shall have the honor of reviewing my troops next summer.
Three-fourths of the men will be recruits; and during my
pilgrimage, discipline seems to have been relaxed. I do not care
to expose the chosen seed to the prophane mockery of the uncircumcised.
But I summon you to fulfil another engagement.
Make me a visit next summer. You will find here a bad house,
a pleasant country in summer, some books, and very little <em>strange</em>
company. Such a plan of life for two or three months must, I
should imagine, suit a man who has been for as many years struck
from one end of Europe to the other like a tennis-ball. At least
I judge of you by myself. I always loved a quiet, studious, indolent
life; but never enjoyed the charms of it so truly, as since
my return from an agreable but fatiguing course of motion and
hurry. However, I shall hear of your arrival, which can scarce
be so soon as January, 1766, and shall probably have the misfortune
of meeting you in town soon after. We may then settle
any plans for the ensuing campaign.</p>

lingo I have imported into this Epistle&mdash;if you had seen that of
Guise to me!) let me tell you a piece of Lausanne news. Nanette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Grand is married to Lieutenant-colonel Prevôt, <em>a poor unfortunate
half-pay officer</em>. Grand wrote to me; and by the next post I
congratulated both father and daughter. There is exactness for
you. The Curchod (Madame Necker) I saw at Paris. She was very
fond of me, and the husband particularly civil. Could they insult
me more cruelly? Ask me every evening to supper; go to bed,
and leave me alone with his wife&mdash;what an impertinent security!
It is making an old lover of mighty little consequence. She is
as handsome as ever and much genteeler; seems pleased with
her fortune rather than proud of it. I was (perhaps indiscreetly
enough) exalting Nanette de Illens's good luck and the fortune.
"What fortune?" said she, with an air of contempt&mdash;"not above
20,000 Livres a year." I smiled, and she caught herself immediately.
"What airs I give myself in despising twenty thousand
Livres a-year, who a year ago looked upon 800 as the summit of

</p>

<div class="sidenote">WANT OF FRIENDS IN LONDON.</div>

<p>I have the pleasure of assuring you that my Rheumatism
(or what else you chuse to call it) has again sounded a
retreat &amp; left me quite well. However I do still intend to consult
a physician by way of precaution, &amp; I think that Physician
shall be Heberden.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> I have seen a number of servants, but
believe I shall pitch upon one who seems very clever without
having anything of the fine Gentleman, &amp; whose demands surprize
me only by their reasonableness. I wrote to his last master at
Bath four or five days ago, &amp; expect an answer with some impatience.&mdash;I
believe I mentioned in my last that I was to introduce
d'Eyverdun to Miss C. at the play. They saw each other: the
Lady with some apparent pleasure; the Gentleman with as little
horror as could be expected. I presented him, proposed a visit,
pressed for time &amp; place; &amp; am by her own appointment to
carry him to pass the evening with her next Monday. The rest
must depend on himself. As to myself; I hardly know myself
as yet, in this immense City; &amp; to speak honestly am not as
yet very highly entertained. I have had some invitations &amp;
expect more, but I must acknowledge, I sometimes regret the
small parties where an acquaintance may pass the evening &amp; sup
without form or invitation. I have however candor enough to
lay these defects rather upon the confined circle of my friends
than on the general manners of the Metropolis. Society (no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
doubt) may be very agreable here, but the avenues to it are fortified
with some care, and I wish I may be able to muster up that
modest assurance which is so necessary to force them. Several
more of my acquaintance Up park, Port Elliott, Hartley,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> are
however come or coming to town &amp; may serve to enliven it.
The public diversions are a great ressource, and the Cocoa Tree<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
serves now and then to take off an idle hour. I am not even
without hopes of being enrolled in the School of Vice which,
notwithstanding the terrors of its name, is as agreable and I
believe as innocent a Club as any in this Metropolis. What I
want the most, is to be taken off the town and to get into private
keeping. You may guess I mean my old scheme of boarding in
a genteel family. You know I have talked of Toriano. I wish
it may succeed, but the very situation of the man which makes
it so agreeable makes it likewise very difficult. Things must
be treated with a degree of delicacy. An acquaintance must be
formed, and I shall not think this winter ill-spent if it lays a good
foundation for next. In the mean time I am looking out for
something to stay my stomach. I have heard of a house near
Leicester fields which appears tolerable, and of another near Soho
whose very situation excludes it.</p>

<p>We wait for Tuesday Sevennight with impatience. Mr. Pitt
is in Town and spoke a great while last Tuesday. He is the
declared Advocate of the Colonies, but a very equivocal one of
the present ministry; tho' great compliments passed between him
&amp; Conway.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The debate yesterday (which lasted till nine in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
evening) was on printing the American papers. The friends to
secresy, thought it much better only to leave them upon the table
for the inspection and copies of about 500 people.&mdash;Almost all
the separations come to nothing except that of L. &amp; Lady B. which
has taken place already.</p>

<p>I forgot upon the study table some maps which I want to
make up into an atlas. Will you be so good, Dear Madam, as to
collect all the French or Latin loose maps in the study and send
them to me by the first opportunity. Pray do not despise me so

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Leger</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARRIAGE OF MR. HOLROYD.</div>

<p>*I happened to-night to stumble upon a very odd piece
of intelligence in the St. James's Chronicle; it relates to the
marriage of a certain Monsieur Olroy,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> formerly Captain of Hussars.
I do not know how it came into my head that this Captain of
Hussars was not unknown to me, &amp; that he might possibly be an
acquaintance of yours. If I am not mistaken in my conjecture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
pray give my compliments to him, &amp; tell him from me, that I am
at least as well pleased that he is married as if I were so myself.
Assure him, however, that tho' as a Philosopher I may prefer
celibacy, yet as a Politician I think it highly proper that the
species should be propagated by the usual method; assure him
even that I am convinced, that if celibacy is exposed to fewer
miseries, marriage can alone promise real happiness, since domestick
enjoyments are the source of every other good. May such
happiness, which is bestowed on few, be given to him; the
transient blessings of beauties, and the more durable ones of
fortune, good sense, and an amiable disposition.</p>

<p>I can easily conceive, and as easily excuse you, if you have
thought mighty little this winter of your poor rusticated friend.
I have been confined ever since Christmas, and confined by a
succession of very melancholy occupations. I was scarce got to
Beriton, where I only proposed staying about a fortnight, when
a brother of Mrs. Gibbon's died unexpectedly, tho' after a very
long and painfull illness. We were scarce recovered from the
confusion which such an event must produce in a family, when
my father was taken dangerously ill, and with some intervalls has
continued so ever since. I can assure you, my dear Holroyd,
that the same event appears in a very different light when the
danger is serious &amp; immediate; or when, in the gayety of a
tavern dinner, we affect an insensibility that would do us no
great honor were it real. My father is now much better; but I
have since been assailed by a severer stroke&mdash;the loss of a friend.
You remember, perhaps, an Officer of our Militia, whom I sometimes
used to compare to yourself. Indeed the comparaison
would have done honor to any one. His feelings were tender
and noble, and he was always guided by them: his principles
were just and generous, and he acted up to them. I shall say
no more, and you will excuse my having said so much, of a man
you had not the least knowledge of; but my mind is just now so
very full of him, that I cannot easily talk, or even think, of
any thing else. If I know you right, you will not be offended
at my weakness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WITH THE MILITIA.</div>

<p>What rather adds to my uneasiness, is the necessity I am
under of joining our Militia the day after to-morrow. Tho' the
lively hurry of such a scene might contribute to divert my ideas,
Yet every circumstance of it, and the place itself, (which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
that of his residence,) will give me many a painful moment. I
know nothing would better raise my spirits than a visit from
you; the request may appear unseasonable, but I think I have
heard you speak of <em>an uncle</em> you had at Southampton. At all
events, I hope you will snatch a moment to write to me, and
give me some account of your present situation &amp; future designs.
As you are now fettered, I should expect you will not be such
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hic et ubique</i>,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> as you have been since your arrival in England.
I stay at Southampton from the 1st to the 28th of May, &amp; then
propose making a short visit to town; If you are any where in
the neighbourood of it, you may depend upon seeing me. I
hope then to concert measures for seeing a little more of you
next winter than I have lately done, as I hope to take a pretty
long spell in town. I suppose the Goat<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> has often fallen in your
way: He has never once wrote to me, nor I to him: in the
Country we want materials, and in London we want time. I
ought to recollect, that you even want time to read my unmeaning
scrawl. Believe, however, my dear Leger, that it is the
sincere expression of a heart entirely yours.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GENERAL ELECTION.</div>

<p>Here I am, and how much longer I may stay in this
little island, Lord knows. Jemmy Worsley is still at Guernsey
upon Election business. I have passed four or five days at
Stenbury with only Sir Thomas, his son, and Jemmy's sister,
rather quietly indeed than agreably. Last night we were
summoned to Newport quite unexpectedly, &amp; this morning Sir
Thomas is gone to Newtown with three Lawyers in order to fix
the boundaries of some borough lands; I expect him back to
dinner, as it is the monthly club of the island, &amp; I fear will be
a drunken day. Upon the whole this is to me a very unpleasant
scene, but I am engaged in it &amp; I can scarce tell how to get
away from it. The first step after the conveyances of my
borough land are finished, is to oblige the Mayor (Holmes
himself) to swear me in a burgess of Newtown; for the constitution
of that borough is of a very mixed nature. Mandamus's
for this purpose are every day expected from the King's
bench; so that, should I leave the island <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pendente lite</i>, I might be
recalled the next day. It is however some comfort that my
conscience will be less burthened than I expected. We were both
mistaken as to that terrible oath which regards only freeholds in
Counties.</p>

<p>As to our success or possibility of success you will excuse my
entering into particulars, especially upon paper &amp; by the post.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
In general we are sanguine, especially at Newtown. Affairs are
incomparably well managed by the advantage of having a great
lawyer acting for himself. He hurries things thro' the courts
with a expedition that is rather uncommon in law proceedings.
The ennemy contrived however to insert into our friend's advertisement
a most curious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quaere</i> which you have probably seen.
The printer will ask pardon or be prosecuted. Power as well as
art is employed. Yesterday we learnt that Captain Lee, who
refused to promise his vote, was turned out of the government of
Carisbroke Castle, (ten shillings a day) and the place given to
Captain Holmet. It seems to occasion a great outcry, and may
perhaps do them more harm than good.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,

<p>The reason I have delayed (besides the usual one) was
the real scarcity of news either of a publick or a private nature.
As to myself I got safe to town, and have lived there in my usual
manner; the Romans,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Boodle's,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> the Theatre and some acquaintances
whom you already know. In all these places nothing new
or interesting has occurred. Ranelagh<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> is indeed opened. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
there last night for the first time. Notwithstanding the brilliancy
of the first moment, I must own I think it very soon grows
insipid to a by-stander, or by-walker if you like it better. I
acknowledge it indeed the most convenient place for courtships of
every kind. It is certainly the best market we have in England.
Lord Abingdon<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> is just going to make a pretty considerable
purchase; of Miss Warren, Mrs. Fitzroy's sister. The Lord wants
money, the Lady a title, so that as the bargain seems advantageous
to both parties we apprehend it will speedily be concluded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VOLTAIRE'S RUIN.</div>

<p>I will not trouble you with election news, as it is both dull
and uncertain. I must however mention that I have seen
Serjeant Glynn,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> who is encouraged by the Sollicitor General<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> to
pursue his petition, and who flatters himself that the Duke of
B. will lend his weight, and that the D. of G. will stand neuter.
He is strongly of opinion that Sir Thomas should be in town to
make interest, and <em>has intended for some time past</em> to write to the
Baronet who sleeps at Pilewell. The opponents (<em>without intending
anything</em>) have already canvassed most of the members. Indeed
there seems to be a general dislike to petitions (of which there
never was known so great a number), and I think most of the
returned members have a very good chance unless they are
attacked by formidable men. Such is the case of Preston<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
fought by Lord Strange, and such I fear will be the case of
Yarmouth; many people at least have a bad opinion both of our
cause and of our interest.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> I do not think this can be called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>

That will be the second act of Lord H.'s Tragi-Comi-farce. As
Osborn &amp; Rodney have exactly all the same votes, if Howe succeeds,
there must be a new election of a second member, and in that case
the two Noble Lords may probably quarrel about the man, which
may compleat the third act of the said farce. I shall say nothing
of Wilkes;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> every man has his story and his opinion, which
mutually destroy each other. Wednesday will decide most of
these disputes, and you may depend on my immediately writing
some particulars of that great day. Lord B.'s tryal<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> is not yet
come out. I will take care to send it with <em>La Princesse de
Babylone</em>,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> a new Romance of Voltaire which is a very agreable
absurd trifle. A propos, poor Voltaire is almost ruined. He had
intrusted most of his money to that expensive scoundrel the Duke
of Wirtenbergh,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> who paid him a much greater interest for it than
anybody else would give. The Duke is ruined, the security worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
nothing and the money vanished. Voltaire has dismissed several
dependants who lived in his house, and even his niece Madam
Denys, all with handsome presents; and keeps only a man and
three maids, with Père Adam an old Jesuit that plays at chess
with him from morning to night. I am really sorry for the
poor old man; as he spent his fortune much better than he
acquired it.</p>

<p>I hear Sir Simeon<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> is confined with the gout to Hartley.

<p>Southouse (with whom Mr. Scott and myself passed
three hours this morning) has examined the Putney Writings.
I wish I could say he was satisfied with them. The former
Deeds (while it was yet a Copyhold) he thinks of little or no
consequence. The Deed of Enfranchisement is what he principally
wants, nor is it sufficient that it may be enrolled in
Chancery or in the Wimbledon Court Rolls. The Deed itself
formerly in your possession is what he wants, for, says he, any
purchaser would naturally be allarmed at it's not being to be
found, and would immediately suspect that some incumbrance
(perhaps for your life only) had been contracted on that security.
I hope and sincerely believe that meer accident or neglect has
deprived us of this important writing, but as it is so important,
we must beg you would recollect all you can about it, and if
possible give us some clue which may lead to a discovery
of it.</p>

<p>There are later papers which he likewise calls for, an authenticated
copy of my Grandfather's Will, your Marriage Settlement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
both with my mother and with Mrs. Gibbon. He wants to be
acquainted with the extent and nature of the fine and recovery
passed by us ten years ago. The Counter Part of Gosling's
Mortgage must be in your hands, and he thinks the sight of it
<em>absolutely</em> necessary. In a word, unless everything is laid before
him, we are only losing our time, and it is impossible to carry
anything beyond meer speculation, not only with regard to any
general Plan, but even in respect to the immediate money we
may want. Whatever can be got either from Public officers or
from the Goslings, &amp;c., he will get, but he judges it both safer and
cheaper that the materials should be laid before him, than that
he should be forced to fish them out. He asked me questions
about the Attornies employed in those several transactions, and
wishes he could see any of their bills, which would inform him
of what had been done. The several leases which actually subsist
between you and any Tenants should be produced. In a word,
he is of opinion that nothing can be done without the whole is
probed to the bottom.</p>

<p>I must therefore desire that you would immediately send up
every thing that can give any light into our affairs. As to
Putney in particular, I must beg you would order Newney to
deliver to my order the leases relating to that Estate. As soon
as I have got some more materials I am again to see Southouse.
I hope they will be speedily in Town, as an expensive Residence
here is neither convenient nor at present agreable.&mdash;I have just
received an answer from Boissier, who can make no offer as he
is not acquainted with our terms, but declines an interview,
and thinks it may suit other people better than himself.</p>

<p>I find the Chancery business cannot be got off, but it may
be so easily delayed that there is no present apprehension from
it. I hope to hear from you by the return of the post, and to
receive <em>as soon as possible</em> every thing you can find. Mr. Scott
is a most zealous friend, and on this as well as on every other
occasion you shall ever find me most truly yours,</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES.</div>

<p>Since my last we still go on, tho' indeed rather slowly.
All that I can say is, that our slowness neither proceeds from our
own negligence, nor even from the dilatoriness of Law, but merely
from our having been destitute of the necessary Writings.
Southouse has been very active, and has already seen Stephen
Harvey, Gosling's Attorney and Mrs. Williamson. The two
former (tho' he has a just idea of Harvey) promise the free use of
all that is in their hands. The last has wrote to her brother &amp;
hopes the Deed may be recovered from him, notwithstanding
he is so odd a man. Harvey believes he may have the Counterpart
of the Mortgage. In a word, we are to meet again next
Wednesday, when Southouse thinks we shall be in a condition to
offer some security for the money we immediately want, as well as
to trace the outlines of our general Deed of trust. As I find I
cannot be a Party in it, I should wish to substitute my uncle
Porten as Joint-Trustee with Mr. Scott.</p>

<p>We should be glad to receive as soon as Possible Mrs. Gibbon's
marriage Articles; In relation to which I shall not <em>forget</em> the
conversation we had in the Study. It is my duty as well as my
inclination to consider her in the light of a real Mother. 2. The
Abstract of the Deeds in Gosling's hands; Hervey, who thinks
he has the counterpart of the Mortgage, is positive he delivered
you this Abstract. 3. The Title, (whatever it is), by which we
possess the Copper share, or at least some account of the Writings
relative to it. To these particular enquiries I must add a general
request of searching out any thing that may give us any new lights.
You have (for instance) made some little purchases about Beriton,
the title to which cannot be included in the general writings of the
Manor, &amp;c. For any thing of that kind the Cocoa Tree is a surer
direction than my obscure lodgings (which are still those of Sir
Thomas's), but I think it would be still better to send them at
once to Mr. Southouse, Attorney at Law, Milk Street, Cheapside.
I have already received and transmitted to him, the Putney Leases
(Vane's signed). Yesterday I had a letter from John Harris,
with some particulars of the Buckinghamshire Estate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>I find Southouse a true man of business; civil but determined
to know everything. He questioned me very plainly about my
change of Religion, of re-conversion to which I gave him very
satisfactory answers. Indeed he will know everything.</p>

<p>I think, Dear Sir, you must be easy after what he said of the
Chancery affair. I asked with some anxiety how long it could be
staved off. What does that signify? answered he. We shall
have the Money before it is wanted.</p>

<p>Depend on it, Dear Sir, we do not wish to flatter you with vain
hopes (indeed to what end could they serve?) and let this consideration
dispell the Fantom which torments you and makes me
so unhappy. Endeavour as far as lies in your power to reassume
both a chearfull heart &amp; and a chearfull countenance. They are
indeed necessary to your health as well as to your Credit.</p>

<p>As for myself, I shall only say that as I cannot be happy, without
your being so, I am willing to make every reasonable sacrifice
to your tranquillity. The only restraints I shall wish to impose on
you are such as will be conducive to our common Good. Perhaps
it had been better for us all, had I insisted on them some years
sooner.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>We had this morning a long conference with Southouse,
who complains very much of the obscurity of our affairs, which is
so great he cannot as yet form even a clear Idea of the difficulties
which surround us. These difficulties however and the delays
which they produce are chiefly owing to your neglecting either
to keep or to send us the necessary writings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES.</div>

<p>Let me beg of you, Dear Sir, not to suffer any indolence or
false delicacy to prevent your going to the bottom of your affairs.
The time of temporary expedients is now passed. Nay, without a
compleat knowledge of things, hardly anything can be done even
at present, for as to borrowing any money on the Putney Estate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Mr. S. thinks it not practicable till a clearer title is made out.
He desires you would immediately send up the Writings of the
Copper share; as that is unencumbered it may form part of a
basis for some temporary security. We will do every thing that
can be done, but these obstacles are not to be so easily surmounted.</p>

<p>I am very unhappy at not being able to send you, <em>for the
present</em>, a more favorable account, and am the more unhappy as
I fear you will even magnify every difficulty, and really make
things worse by the state of your own mind. Upon that head,
Dear Sir, what can I say! what have I to add on so melancholy
a subject. Your health, your credit, Mrs. Gibbon's health and
peace, (I feel for what she must have suffered) my own ease and
fitness for any business, all depends on your resolution.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>I am glad to say that my father's fears from my silence
these last two posts were without foundation, &amp; am sorry to say
that the hopes you conceived from it were not better founded.
The truth really was that I wrote nothing because I had not
anything to write. Yet we had not been idle. I have seen and
talked to W., who answers the idea I had of him tho' not the
character his sister gave of him. She represented him as a shy
melancholy man, he is on the contrary a very sottish but dissipated
man. On my applying for "G," he immediately produced
an Alphabetical Index of Joe Taylor's papers&mdash;Nothing was there
recorded under the name of Gibbon except some old things of
my grandfather's relating to the Duc d'Autem privateer. He
promised to make a further search &amp; I am to call on him
to-morrow, but I hope very little from him. I shall venture to
talk of some gratuity, but in the mean time, we wish my father
and yourself would recollect &amp; search whatever can be found.</p>

<p>My father's last letter distressed me very much. He talks
of my having doubts &amp; suspicions. Whatever unguarded expressions
may have dropped from me, I hope my past conduct
&amp; my present designs are far from deserving the reproach of
doubts &amp; suspicions. At the same time it is true, that tho'
neither myself nor Mr. Scott nor even Mr. Southouse have any
doubts, yet if we want to sell, or even to borrow money on the
Putney Estate, any Purchaser will demand, 1st The Deed of
Enfranchisement, &amp; 2nd My Aunt Elliston's release for £2000
due to her, &amp; charged by my grandfather on the said Putney
Estate. It appears indeed by that will that of his eleven copper
shares, six were left to my aunt Gibbon, five should therefore be
still my father's property, and yet there appears only one &amp; that
sold to my father by Mrs. Elliot.</p>

<p>Mr. S. thinks it absolutely necessary that my father should
come up next week to execute on that occasion, &amp; at the same
time his presence may be usefull to us in other respects: I hope
in my next letter to be able to appoint the day for his coming up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chancery Affair can easily be deferred till the clear title
to Putney is made out, and if my father will not encrease our
difficulties by his own fears we shall yet be happy.</p>

<p>I scarce thought that our present melancholy situation
could receive any addition of uneasiness, but the displeasure your
last letter expressed, convinced me that the meer blows of fortune
are trifling when compared with the unexpected reproaches of
those we love.</p>

<p>Since my arrival in Town Mr. Scott and myself have been
constantly employed on the general plan which will, I flatter
myself, give ease and security to us all. Mr. Southouse has almost
finished the rough Draught of our Deed of Trust, the basis of all
our solid hopes. The many delays which have occurred have
never proceeded from our carelessness. So far from wishing to
expose your name, I consulted S. on the practicability of omitting
the particular Schedule, and a method has been agreed on&mdash;When
that deed of Trust is finished, which will be, I hope, in a very
short time, we shall desire your presence in town. I shall
execute writings by which I make myself liable to near eight
thousand pounds Debt. You will then be able to make use of
Mr. Scott's money, &amp; we shall find means to answer the
Chancery Demands. As yet your credit is unhurt, and your own
fears have been the only importunate Creditor. After this, Dear
Sir, give me leave to ask whether your last expression that you
are <em>still affectionately</em> was not somewhat severe.</p>

<p>I should be truly insensible if the steps you talk of taking in
the Country did not <em>already</em> alarm me. They made me pass a
very cruel night. The very obscurity of your language terrified
me. What can those steps be? I must however say, that
should you intend to procure an immediate supply, by any
extraordinary methods, both Mr. Scott and myself must think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
ourselves disengaged from any promise, and our whole plan is
entirely dissolved.</p>

<p>I have wrote, Dear Sir, from a full heart, for which I make
no apology. It is by actions, not by words, that I shall ever seek
to prove how truly I feel for yourself and poor Mrs. G., and how
ardently I wish to make you, if possible, happy.</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>The discovery of Williamson's papers, tho' in itself a
most pleasing event, is however productive of some delay as well
as trouble. Besides the Deed of Enfranchisement there are two
very large boxes of writings, many no doubt very trifling, but
some which certainly are, and others which possibly may be, of
importance to us. Southouse will examine them with all possible
diligence, but from the new matter which arises, he is obliged for
a very few days to suspend the Deed of Trust, and during that
time, as he has daily occasion to see me, he insists on my not
leaving Town; for which reason you must excuse me, Dear Sir,
from accepting at present the interview which you desire, at
Beriton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROSPECTS OF FUTURE EASE.</div>

<p>Our plan is still the same as what seemed to be agreeable to
your Wishes: To devote the Hampshire and Putney Estates to
the payment of your debts, to convey the Copper and New River
Shares to my use (on my giving up my present annuity of £300
p. annum) and to reserve the Buckinghamshire Estate for your
support. Mr. Scott's £900 will be ready on the signing the
Deeds, and we can <em>now</em> make out so good a title to Putney, that
the disposal of it will be a matter of neither delay nor difficulty.</p>

<p>The only proposed alteration was that you should allow me to
have the nominal possession of the Buckinghamshire Estate,
subject to pay You the whole real profits of it in the form of an
annuity to you, and the Estate itself chargeable with Mrs. Gibbon's
jointure. The very harsh Reception this proposal has met with
from you has given me the deepest concern, as I am conscious of
the rectitude of my intentions &amp; still persuaded of the propriety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the measure. My motives could be only such as were both fair &amp;
even kind. The nominal property of land could afford me no
pleasure, the <em>real management</em> of it must be attended with some
trouble. I am willing, nay desirous, to put it absolutely out of my
power to sell, mortgage, or alienate the smallest portion of it, and
wish to bind myself by the severest ties that the Law can invent,
to pay you regularly half yearly, a method which must be easy to
you and may sometimes be inconvenient to me&mdash;But I shall proceed
no farther on a Subject which appears so disagreeable to you;
I hope indeed I have the less occasion to do it, as Mr. Scott's last
letter must have cleared up some passages of his first, which did
not strike you immediately in their true meaning.</p>

<p>I shall not, Dear Sir, swell this letter, with any vain protestations.
I now see the fairest prospect of future ease and
tranquillity. During the course of this unfortunate transaction I
have endeavoured to have the approbation of my own conscience,
and of our real friends Mr. Porten and Mr. Scott. I flatter myself
that I shall one day obtain yours.</p>

</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to express how much your last
letter surprized and grieved me; as well from the particular
contents of it, as from the general strain of resentment &amp;
dis-satisfaction which runs thro' the whole. To be accused of
neglect, of indifference, of unjust insinuations are reproaches,
which I can only bear because I am conscious of not having
deserved them. I wish to look forwards, &amp; if at any time I
look back, it is only where such a retrospect, however unpleasant,
becomes necessary.</p>

<p>Our Deed of Trust has ever been considered by us all as the
Great Basis of our future conduct, &amp; Mr. Porten, by our mutual
consent. We were to empower them to sell the Hampshire and
Bucks Estates, &amp; to reconvey to us the Remainder (after
payment of Debts, &amp;c.) on certain conditions, which have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
more than once explained. Such was the clear sense of this
Deed, which I thought had been long since understood by us all.
Indeed to put that sense into a Legal form was not in our power.
Southouse is doing that, and it was thought as necessary as it is
usual, that the Attorney's work should be revised by a Lawyer of
some note, Mr. Pechell, a Master in Chancery and particular
friend of Mr. Porten. To these four persons only, the two
Trustees, one Attorney and one Council, has the affair been
exposed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS FATHER'S SCHEME IMPRACTICABLE.</div>

<p>With regard to my possessing the Buckinghamshire Estate in
fee, irrevocably charged with your annuity and Mrs. G.'s jointure;
it was what, after the maturest consideration &amp; the most disinterested
advice, I cannot depart from. Should I ever be idiot
enough to sell it whilst so heavily burdened, no such act could
in the least affect your settled annuity or Mrs. G.'s jointure. I
am however willing to give you my word of honor, that I will
never sell or mortgage any part of it during your life; and that
I will immediately make a Will, by which (supposing I should
die without children before you) I leave the Estate to you in fee
simple. If any legal restraints can be devised, (other than such
as make me for ever a meer life Tenant) I will consent to them
with pleasure: I will do more, I will try to discover them.</p>

<p>So far, Dear Sir, from neglecting our immediate occasion for
money, the Trustees are impowered to borrow whatever sums
may be wanted before the Estates can be disposed of. But I
must add that till the Deed is executed nothing can be done, and
that you are therefore the Cause of the Delays with which you
reproach us. I am the more sensible of a speedy dispatch as the
Chancery affair cannot be put off much longer.</p>

it; many of which related even to your own comfort and happiness,

<p>With regard to your last questions, I can now positively say
that neither household furniture nor stock are comprized in the

latter, and such of the former as is not wanted, will be faithfully
applied by yourself to the same common purposes.</p>

<p>I believe I mentioned some time ago, that the particulars
of Debts will not be described in the Deed of Trust, but in
a private Schedule referred to therein. You will be so good,
Dear Sir, as to prepare and bring the materials of it with you.
The List you gave me at Beriton must already have suffered
some alterations, both as Debtor and Creditor. Besides Clarke's
Debt is as yet unknown.&mdash;Indeed it will be necessary that
previous to your coming up, you should send the Deeds of Copyhold

very cool, and tho' many applications are made, yet nobody as

general slowness in a great measure to the vague description of an

<p>Before I received your last letter I was displeased with
myself for having been so long silent, and yet I should have been
still more displeased if I had wrote, as I could say nothing that
was agreable, nothing but what must lower my father's spirits as
they every day do mine. Tho' we have had many enquiries about
Putney, yet nothing like an offer has presented itself. We must
therefore think of Beriton, and tho' I do not wish to complain,
I must say that we are all surprized at my father's seeming
indifference on that occasion. We feel for the situation both of
his eyes &amp; his spirits, but still we are surprized.&mdash;Things indeed
draw so near a crisis that some resolution must be taken. Mr.
Scott &amp; Mr. Porten propose entering upon it next Week, and
think my presence necessary. As soon as something is settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

hearing every particular which can interest the common cause.</p>

<p>We have agreed with Mr. Wood for the £8500, the
rents and profits till Michaelmas excepted. The writings are sent
to his Lawyer's to-day, and as there is no difficulty in the title, we
may look upon the affair as concluded. Our friends were clearly
of opinion that the measure is prudent, and, every thing considered,
I could not avoid being of the same opinion. But I shall say
the less on that head as they propose writing themselves very soon.
They wish me to remain here till Wood's Lawyer has signified his

<p>Laziness and procrastination are poor excuses for silence;

However at this time, I was partly satisfied by the frequent
[accounts] I received from Beriton both by Pitman's journey &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the channel of Mr. Porten; and I might perhaps have remained
still longer in my Lethargy, had I not been rouzed by the unaccountable
fate which your last letter has met with. Thro'
some strange jumble between Mr. Porten's servant, the maid &amp;
Luke, it has dropt somewhere by the way. This <em>upon my honor</em>
is the exact truth; so that if there was any thing in it which
requires a particular answer I must intreat you to repeat it.</p>

<p>Baron Wentzel is at last arrived, but says himself that he is
at present overwhelmed with business. I submit it to my father
and yourself, whether it may not be better to wait till he shall be
somewhat more at leisure.</p>

<p>This great public scene is still as noisy &amp; as nonsensical as
ever. Particulars would be endless, &amp; indeed the papers are now
so daring that they almost forestall any private intelligence.
Conjectures I leave to men more idle or more busy than myself.
However the general opinion is that the next fortnight
must decide the fate of the ministry.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> If Lord North (whose

<p>A more agreable piece of private news relate to our old arrears,
which we are in a fair way of recovering as the North already
have. Abbot is in town and we are pushing the affair. This
will amount to about £100 for myself, &amp; near double for my
father, and with this I close my Militia service. I have already

surveying and valuing <em>Timber</em> (the surveying land is a separate

reason to be satisfied with their skill and honesty. Their price
for surveying is a guinea a day, or so much in the pound (I don't

<p>I was very happy to hear from Mr. Bayley to-day, that
you was returned to Beriton, &amp; that after a first shock, which I
dread for myself, your reason began to prevail over what must
ever be lamented, but which cannot be recalled. You are, I am
sure, my Dear Madam, so well convinced of my sentiments, and
I am so conscious myself of the weakness of reflection and
argument, that I shall say no more on the subject.</p>

<p>Finding that there were no hopes of Miss Massey, I called on
Mr. Scott this morning, and have, I believe, engaged Mrs.
Williams for the middle of next week. This morning I was at
Doctors' Commons, all was perfectly right, and what was added
proved quite superfluous. Some things that could not be finished,
as well as a little uncertainty about the time Mrs. Williams can
be ready, will defer my departure till about Wednesday or
Thursday. There are many reasons why I wish to return to
Beriton, as soon as I can.</p>

Pall Mall, December the 4th, 1770.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>I have now been about ten days in town. The scene
of Beriton was too melancholy to support, and with respect to
health as well as to spirits I found a change of scene and air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
absolutely requisite. Mrs. Gibbon went for a few days to
Bayley's, who, both husband and wife, have behaved in the most
friendly manner on the occasion. To-morrow I propose returning
to Beriton, and shall carry with me Mrs. Williams, a daughter of
Poet Mallet, whose lively company will I hope contribute to
divert poor Mrs. Gibbon during the gloom of the Winter.</p>

<p>With regard to business, you are sensible, Dear Sir, that it is
not yet in my power to say much about it. The most pressing
part I have attended to, and the interest to Goslings will be
entirely paid by next Saturday. The next month which I shall
spend at Beriton will afford me time and opportunity for looking
into the state of it, the profits and expences of the farm, the
value of the Estate, and the probable encrease of it in respect to
timber; I hope to return to town with such materials as may
enable me rationally to decide which of the Estates it will be most
prudent to part with. At present I incline (and it seems to be
very much Mr. Porten's sentiment) towards keeping and letting
Beriton. As soon as a resolution is taken, not a moment should
be lost in the execution. I shall always hope, Dear Sir, for the
continuance of your advice and friendship, and beg that you
would believe me,</p>

I could not refuse her so short a delay. Every thing is now

<p class="head">
December, 1770.

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS AUNT'S CONDOLENCES.</div>

<p>In the midst of the justest affliction nothing could
afford me a greater consolation than your kind letter: as it
convinced me that the nearest relation of my poor father shared
my grief, and still interested herself in my future Welfare.
Some immediate business which called me to town prevented my
answering it directly, nor indeed did I find myself able to enter
so soon into the melancholy detail which you are desirous of
hearing.</p>

<p>The first affliction with which my father was visited, was a
gradual decay of sight, which at last terminated in an almost total
blindness. With his sight he lost almost every pleasure of life,
as he could no longer enjoy the country nor attend to the business
of the farm, in which for many years his chief amusement and
occupation had consisted. Tho' he bore this severe stroke with
surprizing fortitude and resignation, yet the effect it had on his
health and spirits began to alarm us very much, when last spring
we were still more terrified by the symptoms of an approaching
dropsy; a shortness of breath, swelling of the legs and body and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the loss of rest, strength and appetite. The Physician who
attended him encreased our apprehensions by confessing his own
difficulties, as he was well assured that Mr. G.'s constitution could
not support the usual methods external or internal, which might
otherwise be proper for his disorder. In the month of August
however a favourable Revolution seemed to happen. Dr. Addington,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
whom a friend in London consulted, advised the use of
broom ashes. They immediately produced a very great evacuation
of Water, reduced my father's legs and body to their natural size,
and for a while gave us very great room to hope, tho' our hopes
were at the same time mixed with so many fears as prevented us
from writing to any of our friends at a distance. My father
himself kept us from taking such a step, by insisting that Mrs.
Eliott should not be acquainted with his situation, for fear her
tenderness should bring her to Beriton and expose him to an
interview to which his strength and spirits were not equal. At
length, Dear Madam, after several turns in his disorder, which all
gave him a temporary relief, without in the least restoring his
strength, my poor father was on Tuesday the 6th of last month
taken with a fainting fit. They returned several times during
the week with more or less violence, but during the intervals
between them he was perfectly easy and composed. The fatal
one of Monday the 12th began about Noon and lasted near six
hours, tho' we have every reason to think that he suffered very
little in the last struggle. Nature was entirely exhausted and his
disorder, whatever appearances it might assume, was a total decay
of the constitution.</p>

<p>Long before the melancholy event my father was sensible of
his approaching end, and prepared himself for it with the truest
resignation; besides his private prayers he was attended by the
Clergyman of the Parish, from whom he received the Communion,
who testified the highest satisfaction in his edifying behaviour.
But my father's best preparation was the comfort of a well-spent
life. He was followed to the grave by the tears of a whole
country which for many years had experienced his goodness and
charity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE STATE OF HIS AFFAIRS</div>

<p>There is one circumstance indeed which I would conceal even
from you, were it possible to conceal it from the World. Economy
was not amongst my father's Virtues. The expences of the more
early part of his life, the miscarriage of several promising
schemes, and a general want of order and exactness involved him
in such difficulties as constrained him to dispose of Putney, and
to contract a mortgage so very considerable that it cannot be
paid unless by the sale of our Buckinghamshire Estate. The only
share I have ever taken in these transactions has been by my
sensibility to my father's wants and my compliance with his
inclinations, a conduct which has cost me very dear, but which I
cannot repent. It is a satisfaction to reflect that I have fulfilled,
perhaps exceeded my filial duties, and it is still in my power with
the remains of our fortunes to lead an agreable and rational life.
I am sensible that as no Estate will answer the demands of vice
and folly, so a very moderate Income will supply the real wants of
Nature and Reason.</p>

<p>I have now, Dear Madam, gone thro' the heads of what I
apprehended to be most interesting to you. Should there be any
other points, about which you wish for farther information, I
shall esteem myself happy in giving you all the satisfaction in
my power, as well as in embracing every opportunity of convincing
you, with how much truth and regard</p>

gives me shews the necessity of it. I have not yet been able

<p>I have advanced with some care and some success in
gaining an Idea of the Bucks Estate. The Tenants are at Will,
and from a compairison with my rents with the neighbouring ones,
particularly Lord Verney,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> there is great probability that my
Estate is very much underlet. My friend Holroyd, who is a most
invaluable Counsellor, is strongly of that opinion.</p>

<p>I am at a loss what to say about Mrs. Lee's letter, as I do not
well understand what you mean by her mistake, but if the account
is fair and can be conveniently paid from the farm money, I
think it would be right to satisfy her. However a short delay
can make but little difference.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear that William has the gout. My best
wishes to him, respects to Mrs. Williams &amp; compliments to the

<p class="head">
Pall Mall, February 4th, 1771.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>After passing the Christmas at Beriton, I returned to
town about three Weeks ago. The friendly part you have taken
in my affairs, would render me inexcusable, if I omitted to
acquaint you with what has been done, as well as to consult you
in relation to what ought to be done.</p>

<p>With regard to the Goslings I have paid them a full year's
interest to last November. Seven hundred and forty-seven
Pounds is a severe pull, and I told Clive in a jocose manner but
with great truth, that if he was tired of being my Landlord, I was
most heartily so of being his tenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">WAYS AND MEANS</div>

<p>In my last I expressed an inclination of parting with Lenborough
rather than with Beriton, but in these complicated affairs,
so many opposite reasons combat each other that I now incline
to execute, if possible, the original plan. We always knew the
Bucks to be a most desirable Estate, but I am now convinced
that it is a very improvable one. My Lands are let at twenty-three
per acre, those of Lord Verney in the same parish and
intermixed with mine let for nine &amp; twenty. See the difference.
23&frac12;, 29; £636, £785. And this account I had too from
John Harris, who seems frightened out of his Wits, for fear I
should raise the rents; which it is always in my power to do, as
the Tenants are only at will, and without any leases. But I
shall soon know things more exactly, as a very trusty and able
man is sent down to value the Estate.</p>

<p>The Hampshire Estate on the other hand receives a great
drawback from the Woods and Manour; the former produce no
interest, nor can I afford to wait the slowness of their growth;
the latter, tho' extremely valuable to a Sportsman and Country
Gentleman, would be to me only a source of vexation, expence,
lawsuits, quarrels, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>In order then to proceed in that line, it was necessary to get
all those Writings, which old Southouse has kept these two years
without any receipt, that we might examine whether we had a
good saleable title. The old Gentleman has shewn a reluctance
in the restoring them which was very far from pleasing. The
best and perhaps the true motive is his carelessness of business,
and frequent stay in the Country, but even that was a sufficient
reason for taking my business out of his hands. I am strongly
recommended by Mr. Porten and other friends to employ Mr.
Newton, a man of character and ability, who has great experience
in the branch of buying and selling Estates. I shall not take
that or any other step of consequence without your praevious
approbation, and in case you have not any person in view I
should directly employ Newton. Southouse refuses to deliver up
the Copy of our Deed of trust, which was designed for the
trustees, without your order. Would it be disagreable to you, to
send us a line by the return of the post, directing him to deliver
up the Deed to your brother Trustee?</p>

<p>As soon as I have put this business in train I shall return for
some time to Beriton, to compleat the surveys and other things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
begun there. I say nothing of Mrs. G., as I presume you
correspond with her.</p>

<p>If the weather with you is only half as uncomfortable
as it is in town, Beriton must indeed be a most dismal place.
We are cut in two with the cold, and buried in the deepest snow
that ever I saw in London. This circumstance makes my presence
with you the less necessary, as it would not be possible for Bricknall
or any body else to do anything in the surveying way. As
soon as I see a possibility I shall write to him to undertake it,
and shall beg Hugonin to assist him with his directions. The
Woods (an account of which he has given me) amount to £3500.
It was about what I expected. I had a letter from Hugonin, to
whom I excused me not attending the Court. He desires to
become my tenant for a field. I am ignorant of circumstances,
but <em>think</em> he would not ask anything improper.</p>

<p>The business of settling the Beriton title, with the Lawyer
here, seems to be now the most urgent affair. I hope, but cannot
promise, that by the end of next week it may be sufficiently
advanced to allow me to come down. I most truly pity poor
Mrs. W., and should think that if Beriton is so insupportable to
her, she might come up by herself in the Machine. I hope her
spirits, your health and Patton's gout are all better.</p>

<p>Will you be so good as to order Tregus up to town with the
horse. He must bring him to Wisdom's Livery Stable, Park

<div class="sidenote">WARM DEFENCE OF HIS HONOUR.</div>

<p>I am much obliged to your friendship, for the advice
you have given me with regard to my future conduct, and shall
always pay the most sincere deference to it. Both prudence and
inclination will engage me to get rid of the farm as soon as such
a complicated piece of business can be transacted. With respect
to my expences they shall always be proportioned to my income,
and I am already preparing to discharge a cook, a groom, and
other unnecessary Servants. There is one part of your letter
which has given me, Dear Madam, very great uneasiness. You
say that you have heard from undoubted authority that my own
imprudences had so much embarrassed me, as to oblige me to make
a concession which otherwise I might not have done. Were I
conscious of these imprudencies, I should fairly acknowledge
them, and endeavour by future behaviour to make some amends
for past follies. But an innocent person has a right to speak a
very different language. I know my own innocence, and without
any vain protestations of it, I will at once come to such facts as
must either establish it, or else expose me not only as a prodigal,
but as a man devoid of honour and veracity. I therefore
solemnly affirm the truth of the following facts.</p>

<p>1. When I returned from Switzerland about twelve years and
a half ago, my father told me his affairs were a good deal
embarrassed, and desired that I would joyn in cutting off the
entail and in raising £10,000. I was then a raw lad of one and
twenty, unacquainted with law or business, and desirous of
obliging my father. He then gave me three hundred a year,
a moderate allowance to which his eldest son would have had a
natural claim, had no such transaction intervened.</p>

<p>2. Upon and within that allowance, I have constantly lived,
except during two years and a half that I was abroad the second
time. Whilst I was abroad I spent about seven hundred a year, a
sum which, with the unavoidable expences of travelling, barely
supports the appearance of an English gentleman.</p>

<p>3. I have never on any occasion received from my father any
pecuniary inducements to consent to any step whatsoever, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
once, four hundred pounds, near £100 of which were arrears of
my allowances, and about the same sum I returned to my father
when he wanted it very much.</p>

<p>4. I have never lost at play a hundred pounds at any one
time; perhaps not in the course of my life. Play I neither love
nor understand.</p>

<p>5. I have never taken up any money for myself, in any way
whatever.</p>

<p>6. Neither at my father's death nor at any other period have
I ever had any other debts than common tradesmen's bills, which
are paid from one year to another, and even those to a very
trifling amount.</p>

<p>I have tried to answer a general charge, as far as a general
charge can be answered. But for our mutual satisfaction, let
me intreat you, Dear Madam, to communicate that part of my
letter to the persons from whom you received your intelligence.
Desire that without sparing me they would contradict <em>by facts</em>
any of those which I have advanced, or that they would mention
any which I have suppressed. If they are unable to do this, your
candour must allow that they were either weakly deceived, or
wicked Deceivers. As I neither know nor wish to know who
they are, Charity induces me to believe the former rather than to
suspect the latter.</p>

<p>I think, Dear Madam, you will excuse my warmth. I should
deserve the imputation could I submit to it with patience. As
long as you credit it, you must view me in the light of a specious
Hypocrite, who meanly cloaked his own extravagancies under his
father's imprudence, and who ascribed to filial piety what had
been the consequence of folly and necessity. As long as you
credit it, I must be deprived of the esteem of a person, whose
good opinion and friendship it will ever be my wish and study to
deserve.</p>

</p>

<p>I set down to answer your Epistle, after taking a very
pleasant ride.&mdash;<em>A Ride! and upon what?</em>&mdash;Upon a horse.&mdash;"<em>You
lye!</em>"&mdash;I don't. I have got a droll little Poney, and
intend to renew the long-forgotten practice of Equitation, as it
was known in the World before the 2nd of June of the year
of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and sixty-three. As
I used to reason against riding, so I can now argue for it; and
indeed the principal use I know in human reason is, when called
upon, to furnish arguments for what we have an inclination
to do.*</p>

<p>I am obliged to you, for looking me out this Lancashire Man,
who may assuredly be of use, and no less so for your intercession
with Gosling or Clive. If he and his Partner will condescend to
receive my Tribute, I am in no violent hurry to dispose of the
Place, which under Mrs. Gibbon's management is certainly no
losing Game. She thanks you for your Papers, and has delivered
the <cite>Roster</cite> to Mr. Luff, who, though it is new, likes it hugely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FARMER GIBBON</div>

<p>*What do you mean by presuming to affirm, that I am of no
use here? Farmer Gibbon of no use! <em>Last week</em> I sold all my
Hops, and I believe well, at nine Guineas a hundred, to a very
responsible Man. Some people think I might have got more at
Weyhill Fair, but that would have been an additional expence,
and a great uncertainty. Our quantity has disapointed us very
much; but I think, that besides hops for the house, there will
not be less than 500<em>l.</em>;&mdash;no contemptible Sum of thirteen small
Acres, and two of them planted last year only. <em>This week</em> I let a
little Farm in Petersfield by auction, and propose raising it from
25<em>l.</em> to 35<em>l.</em> pr. annum: and Farmer Gibbon of no use!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>To be serious; I have but one reason for resisting your
invitation and my own wishes; that is, Mrs. Gibbon I left nearly
alone all last Winter, and shall do the same this. She submits
very chearfully to that state of solitude; but, on sounding her,
I am convinced that she would think it unkind were I to leave
her at present. I know you so well, that I am sure you will
acquiesce in this reason; and let me make my next Visit to
Sheffield-Place from town, which I think may be a little before
Christmas. I should like to hear something of the precise time,
duration, and extent of your intended tour into Bucks. Adieu.*</p>

his interest with his cousin the Duke of Dorset. The mistake

judgement, and that Judgement my own, for even Mrs. G. wanted
me to keep them for Wayhill Fair, where they were a mere drug.
The little farm, I told you of, I have raised from £25 to £38 pr.

The Physician and the Queen ruled him entirely, and had led
him into measures which had disgusted the old Ministry, the
Nobility and at last the Army. The Mal-contents linked themselves
with the Queen Dowager and her son, and the weak
Monarch is now in their hands. Mothers-in-law are very dreadful
animals, and he stands a very poor chance indeed. His wife is

Order of &mdash;&mdash; Ladies were to be founded, she would be the

<p>I did not intend to have troubled you till Monday or

requesting some game, to answer a hare, on Wednesday. At this
season I know of no game but a Turkey. Holroyd is in town,
as active but not so effectual as I could wish. He is pleased with
Bricknall's <em>four</em> plans, but wishes that he would sketch out the
outlines of them, on a single piece of paper, that their relative
situation may be seen at one view. Adieu, Dear Madam, and

Boodle's, 10 o'clock, Monday night, Feb. 3rd, 1772.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROYAL MARRIAGE ACT.</div>

<p>*I love, honour, and respect every member of Sheffield-place;
even my great enemy Datch,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> to whom you will please to convey
my sincere wishes, that no <em>simpleton</em> may wait on him at dinner,
that his wise Papa may not show him any pictures, and that his
much wiser Mamma may chain him hand and foot, in direct
contradiction to Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OPENING OF THE PANTHEON.</div>

<p>It is difficult to write news&mdash;because there are none. Parliament
is perfectly quiet; and I think that Barré,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> who is just now
playing at Whist in the Room, will not have exercise of the lungs,
except, perhaps, on a Message much talked of, and soon expected,
to recommend it to the wisdom of the H. of C. to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
a proper future remedy against the improper marriages of the
younger branches of the royal family.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The noise of Lutteral<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> is
subsided, but there was some foundation for it. The Colonel's
expenses in his bold enterprise were yet unpaid by government.
The Hero threatened, assumed the Patriot, received a sop, and
again sunk into the Courtier. As to Denmark, it seems now that
the king, who was totally unfit for government, has only passed
from the hands of his Queen Wife to those of his Queen Mother-in-Law.
The former is said to have indulged a very <em>vague</em> taste
in her Amours. She would not be admitted into the Pantheon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
from whence the <em>Gentlemen Proprietors</em> exclude all beauty, unless
unspotted and immaculate (tautology, by the by). The <em>Gentlemen
Proprietors</em>, on the other hand, are friends and patrons of the
Leopard Beauties. Advertising challenges have passed between
the two Great Factions, and a bloody battle is expected Wednesday
Night. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A propos</i>, the Pantheon, in point of Ennui and

<p>*Though it is very late and the bell tells me that I have not
above ten minutes left, I employ them with pleasure in congratulating
you on the late Victory of our Dear Mamma the
Church of England.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> She had last Thursday 71 rebellious sons,

217 Worthy Champions, headed by Lord North, <em>Burke</em>, Hans
Stanley, Charles Fox, Godfrey Clarke, &amp;c., though they allowed
the thirty-nine clauses of her Testament were absurd and unreasonable,
supported the validity of it with infinite humour.
By the by, C. F. prepared himself for that holy war, by passing
twenty-two hours in the pious exercise of Hazard; his devotions
cost him only about £500 per hour&mdash;in all £11,000. Gaby lost
£5000. This is from the best authority. I hear, too, but will
not warrant it, that Will Hanger,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> by way of paying his court to
L. C., has lost this winter £12,000. How I long to be ruined!</p>

<p>There are two county contests, Sir Thomas Egerton and
Colonel Townley in Lancashire,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> after the county had for some
time gone a-begging. In Salop, Sir Watkin, supported by Lord
Gower, happened by a punctilio to disoblige Lord Craven, who
told us last night, that he had not quite £9000 a-year in that
county, and who has set up Pigot against him. You may suppose
we all wish for Got Almighty,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> against that Black Devil.</p>

<p>I am sorry your journey is deferred. No news from Fleet
Street. What shall I do? Compliments to Datch. As he is
now in Durance, great minds forgive their enemies, and I hope
he may be released by this time.&mdash;&mdash;Coming, sir. Adieu.</p>

<p>You see the P[rincess] of W[ales] is gone. Hans Stanley
says, it is believed the Empress Queen<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> has taken the same

Dear H.,

<div class="sidenote">GOSSIP OF THE TOWN.</div>

<p>The principal object of my writing to-night is to
acquaint you, that the old Anabaptist has escaped Damnation
by sending in his papers, &amp;c., on the 10th Instant, the destined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>

with you: I wait your orders; nor shall I, for fear of tumbling,
take a single step till your arrival, which, on many accounts, I
hope will not be long deferred.* No news from Fleet Street!
What is their surveyor about?</p>

<p>*Clouds still hover over the Horizon of Denmark. The public
circumstances of the Revolution are related, and, I understand,
very exactly, in the foreign Papers. The secret springs of it
still remain unknown. The town, indeed, seems at present quite
tired of the subject. The Princess's death,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> her Character, and
what she left, engross the Conversation. She died without a will;
and as her savings were generally disposed of in Charity, the small
remains of her personal fortune will make a trifling object when
divided among her Children. Her favourite, the P[rincess] of
B[runswick]<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> very properly insisted on the K.'s immediately sealing
up all the papers, to secure her from the Idle reports which
would be so readily swallowed by the great English Monster.
The business of L. and Lady Grosvenor<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> is finally compromised,

gives her £1200 a year separate maintenance, and £1500 to set
out with; but, as her Ladyship is now a new face, her Husband,
who has already bestowed on the public seventy young Beauties,
has conceived a violent but hopeless passion for his chaste Moiety.*
Her brother Vernon told me, that he has now in his hands a
counter-affidavit of Countess Denhoff, in which she declares that
she received a sum of money to swear the former, the contents
of which are totally false. Such infamous conduct may blast
her, but can never acquit the other; any more than another

<p>I would tell you that I have been somewhat out of order;
a foulness or fullness, call it as you please, in my stomach which
occasioned an ache as well there as in my head, and indeed a general
languor all over me. Turton, whom I called to my assistance,

<p>Bricknall is gone down to Holroyd in the same condition as
I received him. I expect that great man in town in a few days,
and hope that his active Genius will hasten and facilitate everything.
You are so good as to say, dear Madam, that you had

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear H.</span>,
</p>

<p>An exact man should acknowledge the receipt of Letters,
Papers, &amp;c. How do I know for instance whether my Hampshire
Acres, the long expected fruits of my Anabaptist's Labours, may
not be sunk, irrecoverably sunk in the Sussex Dirt? *However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
notwithstanding my indignation, I will employ five minutes in
telling you two or three recent pieces of News.</p>

<p>1. Charles Fox is commenced Patriot, and is already attempting
to pronounce the words <em>Country</em>, <em>Liberty</em>, <em>Corruption</em>, &amp;c.;
with what success, time will discover. Yesterday he resigned the
Admiralty.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The most probable account seems to be, that he
could not prevail on Ministry to join with him in his intended
repeal of the Marriage Act (a favourite measure of his father,
who opposed it from its origin,) and that Charles very judiciously
thought Lord Holland's friendship imported him more than Lord
North's.</p>

<p>2. Yesterday the Marriage Message came to both Houses of
Parliament. You will see the words of it in the Papers; and,
thanks to the submissive piety of this Session, it is hoped that
the Princes of the next Generation will not find it so easy as their
Uncles have done to expose themselves and to burthen the Public.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. NOWELL'S SERMON.</div>

<p>3. To-day the House of C. was employed in a very odd way.
Tommy Townshend<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> moved, that the Sermon of Dr. Knowell, who
preached before the House on the 30th of January (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">id est</i>, before
the Speaker and four Members,) should be burnt by the Common
Hangman, as containing arbitrary, Tory, High-flown doctrines.
The House was nearly agreeing to the Motion, till they recollected
that they had already thanked the Preacher for his excellent
discourse, and ordered it to be printed. Knowell's Bookseller
is much obliged to the Right Honourable Tommy Townshend.</p>

<p>I admit the justice of your kind reproaches, and without
attempting any idle excuses, I will endeavour to prove my
repentance by my amendment. We are now (Holroyd and myself)
very busy, but with much less success than I could wish.
Though it has been mathematically demonstrated to the Goose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that at twenty-two, he would make near 3 pr. cent. of his money,
the Goose, for such he most truly is, after a long shuffling dilatory
suspense, without being able to find out his own foolish mind,
has this morning told me that he must at least for the present
decline it. We immediately proceed to an Advertisement, and
the Oracle has made the value of the thing so clear even to me
that I am almost as sanguine as himself. We are soon to have
a Conference about Beriton. He thinks the map you have sent
will be of use, and prevent his losing his Way, when he goes
down with me about Easter, as he will certainly do. As from
Bricknall's slowness it was impossible to let the Farms at Lady
Day, they can only be let at Michaelmas: and we, however
reluctantly, go through another and last Harvest. I am doubly
anxious that it should be the last, not only to have my own
affairs in a smaller compass and clearer order, but likewise to
release you, dear Madam, from a melancholy situation, which
your affection for me has persuaded you to undertake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR RICHARD WORSLEY.</div>

<p>*Sir Richard Worsley<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> is just come home. I am sorry to see
many alterations, and little improvement. From an honest wild
English buck, he is grown a <em>philosopher</em>. Lord Petersfield displeases
every body by the affectation of consequence: the young baronet
disgusts no less by the affectation of wisdom. He speaks in short
sentences, quotes Montaigne, seldom smiles, never laughs, drinks
only water, professes to command his passions, and intends to
marry in five months. The two lords, his uncle as well as
Jemmy, attempt to show him that such behaviour, even were it
reasonable, does not suit this country. He remains incorrigible,
and is every day losing ground in the good opinion of the public,
which at his first arrival ran strongly in his favour. Deyverdun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
is probably on his journey towards England, but is not yet
come.*</p>

<p>The attention of the Public is much engaged about the
Marriage Bill. The Princes of the Blood will lose their natural
rights, and a most odious law will be forced upon Parliament.
I do not remember ever to have seen so general a concurrence of
all ranks, parties, and professions of men. Administration themselves
are the reluctant executioners, but the King will be obeyed,
and the bill is universally considered as his, reduced into legal or
rather illegal form by Ld. Mansfield and the Chancellor. By
the bye, the Duke of Manchester told me the other day that since
the bill Lady Waldegrave has authorized all her friends to declare
that she <em>is</em> married. The Duke and Duchess of C[umberland] are
in town, but live in princely solitude. He drives her about the
streets in a Phaeton, and they have sometimes concerts to which
none but the Luttrel family are admitted.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>Two reasons (assisted, as you will, by a laziness of
nature) have kept me silent for several posts. The one of a
pleasant, the other of a disagreeable kind.</p>

<p>1. Deyverdun is at length arrived, and has explained fully to
my satisfaction the reasons of his whole conduct, tho' they are
such as it is not permitted me to reveal. Lord Chesterfield was
not in the least offended at having been obliged to wait, and my
friend with young Stanhope sets out for the University of Leipsic
about the middle of next week. As I have so short a period to
enjoy his Company between two such intervals of separation, I am
obliged to give up every other engagement, and to sacrifice every
other business in order to snatch the hours which he is able to
give me. He begs his most gratefull compliments to you, and
laments that his time will not allow him to present them himself.</p>

<p>2. The other reason was an inflammation in my Eyes, which
is now perfectly removed, but which I had most richly deserved
by going from a melting Garrick's to cool myself at Vauxhall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENQUIRIES AS TO THE CROPS.</div>

<p>The Oracle is astonished at the general neglect of the World
about Lenborough. He commands me, if they do not come in
sooner, to raise the rents myself at Michaelmas. In the meanwhile
he is not in a hurry about the farm, thinks that both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
transactions should move together, and is sure that I do not lose
by it. I am not disinclined to follow his advice, and my only
objection is on your account. I am exceedingly glad to hear the
Goulds are preparing to visit us. I say us, for I hope to meet
them on or before the last day of this month. I shall likewise
write to Holt. Pray how does the Corn&mdash;and the Hops look?&mdash;I
called on Sir John Miller this morning and found him laid up
with the small-pox. Sir Matthew is breaking up very fast.</p>

you may well suppose) are impatient, and will expect to hear from
me as soon as I get down: but as your company and assistance

come. I must therefore beg the favour of a line.&mdash;My

<p class="head">
Beriton, September the 25th, 1772.
</p>

<p>Blessings on the man (his name is now buried in oblivion) who
first invented the loud trumpet of Advertisements. Blessings on
those two great men, the intrepid Holroyd and the prudent
Hugonin, without whose charitable aid the wretched Gibbon
must for ever have grovelled in the mire of Beriton.</p>

<p>We much depended, as you may remember, on the Rumsey
Farmer and the Distiller. But&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omne quod humanum instabile</i>.
The latter never replied to the letter which I sent him, the
former missed the appointed Wednesday and threw me into an
agony of despair, which was soon changed into joy on the
discovery that I had escaped a very indifferent Tenant. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
candidates succeeded, a letter from Norfolk, and farmers of
various appearance and from different places. Luff (I believe he
used no foul play) always chose to show the farm, and then conducted
them to Hugonin, who debated the matter with them over
a bowl of Punch and then acquainted me with the result. It
would be tedious and at present of little use to expatiate on the
objections, difficulties, &amp;c. At last a Farmer named Winton
from Shoreham who knows you (by the bye, all the farmers abuse
you, a high compliment!) made his appearance: the father is a
man of substance, 200 a year of his owne, the son a brisk active
fellow about thirty, both of unexceptionable character, and
throughout the whole transaction uncommonly fair and candid.
They take all my stock at an appraisement, sheep excepted (they
don't like the sort), and allow me a year for repairs, about which
they gladly take Hugonin for Umpire, and have not indeed
demanded any one unreasonable thing. I have given at their
request a thirty years' lease, and immediately signed a legal article.
Monday sennight the stock will be appraised by one on each side.</p>

<p>In a word, all is settled and (though I have given up something
of the proposed rent) I should think it one of the most
agreeable days of my life, were it not embittered by the uneasiness
I feel on Mrs. G.'s account. She refused to yield an iota of her
pretensions, and even to allow the Tenant any Rick Yard, or a
way from the Lawn into his farm-yard. She was repeatedly told
that every farmer did and ever would reject the farm on such
terms. At length she gave Hugonin authority to say that she
had given up all thoughts of the place: but her temper both then
and since has been very different from what I could wish it. She
is angry if she is not constantly consulted, and yet takes up
everything with such absolute quickness, that we all dread to
consult her. She is at present I fear equally offended with me,
with Hugonin and Mr. Scott. Nothing shall however abate my
regard for her, and as soon as I can discover whether she will fix
on Bath or some country place, she may command every service
within my power. All this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub sigillo amicitiæ</i>.</p>

<p>I am summoned to dress. The Jolliffes dine here. Adieu.

<p class="head">
Beriton, 3rd October, 1772.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">BERITON LET.</div>

<p>*I am so happy, so exquisitely happy, at feeling so many
Mountains taken off my shoulders, that I can brave your
indignation, and even the three-forked lightning of Jupiter
himself. My reasons for taking so unwarrantable a step (approved
of by Hugonin) were no unmanly despondency (though it daily
became more Apparent how much the farm would suffer, both
in reality and in reputation, by another year's management),*
but the following grounds. 1. The being secure against repairs
for so long a term, and 2. The giving the Tenant a durable
interest to use my land like his own. The Revolutions of this
country may take various turns within that period; nor do I
recollect that, although you fixed on 21 years, you so strongly
disaproved of a longer term. However the Mischief is done;
and I can only wish that, at or about Michaelmas in the year of
our Lord God one Thousand seven hundred and ninety-three, you
convince me that Gib-ben knows no more of country business
than Maria, which by that time most probably will be very true.
The rent after deducting Ponds, Yards, &amp;c. (which every tenant
objected to) is very little short of the grand desideratum twenty
and ten, a price which fills the country round with terror and
amazement. The Tenant is confessedly rich, and in this whole
transaction about Covenants, repairs &amp;c., has shewn himself the
reverse of <em>eminently troublesome</em>. The father may perhaps be
slovenly, the son who is properly my Tenant is (in H.'s opinion)
a very active, clever, sensible fellow.</p>

<p>But to turn from the past to the future. <em>My Bucks Tenants</em>
have all consented (though 'tis very "<em>heard</em>") to pay Church and
Poor, but before they sign the paper, they wish to wait on me,
either here or in London, and Harris hints to me their intended
request, "That they may have the cutting of the Hedges for wood
for their own use, but not to sell any; and to cut such hedges
as I think proper, and so much in the year; to be done in a
husband-like manner, and to do all their own repairs, thatching
and everything." On consulting Hugonin, I found that what
they ask is allowed in this part of the country, so that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
almost enclined by sending them a gracious permission to secure
their signature and prevent the deputation of the Savages.
However I wait for orders. It is of more consequence to consider
what further steps may be taken with regard to the disposal of
Lenborough; for as I now see land, I am very impatient to get
ashore. Suppose <em>you made Gosling</em> acquainted with all difficulties
being smoothed and made him a final offer for&mdash;the Mortgage
<em>and</em> £5000 shall we say? It is surely worth it. If he refuses
We have no resource but the hazardous one of a Auction. Think
of it: and of the steps to be taken, and whether in the last case
we may not <em>divide</em> with success.</p>

<p>Mrs. G. is now cheerfull and I hope satisfied: but I fancy
<em>will hardly accept</em> of your obliging invitation this year. To-morrow
we appraise the stock. The <em>week after I carry my</em> Hops to
Weyhill. On my return we shall find much to do in settling the
plan of selling my corn during the winter, selecting the choicest
furniture and preparing for <em>an auction of the rest</em>. She is then
desirous of going to look about her at Bath, where I shall attend
her, and on my return shall be impatient to examine London in
quest of a comfortable habitation. We shall probably meet when
you are on your Surrey (I suppose Richmond) scheme, and you
will find me a sure resource in the bleak season when you can get
nobody else. Adieu.</p>

<p>I am most seriously uneasy with regard to what you say
of Mrs. H., her health, her spirits and her thinness. I wish she
may receive benefit from Dr. Pepys's prescription, but am of
opinion that change of air and amusements would prove the best
Physician. Recollect the service our little tour was to her,
consider that the evenings are growing long and Sheffield Place
affords no variety of objects or company. <em>You know she loves
Bath</em>, which is now in season, and I should think that place

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LEAVING BERITON.</div>

<p>You know as much as I do of Lord Verney's tythe. Harris
has not answered that part of my letter; probably he had not
seen his Lordship. I write to him by this post to enquire into
that matter, &amp; to order him absolutely <em>to lett the Underwood</em>, and,
if he can, to prevail on the Tenants to pay something more for
the liberty of cutting the hedges. Whatever is done about the
sale must be <em>done quickly</em>, and on that account I fear not so well.
The Goslings are impatient. I know not how to ask them for
another year, and to take up so large a sum for one Year only
would be attended with much difficulty and expence. They wish,
if I cannot speedily dispose of Bucks, I would pay off part by the
sale of the New River share, for which I know they have a
hankering. It is a most delicious bit of Property, and I should
be sorry to part with it for such a price as one commonly gets
by a forced sale. If they would give me a <em>rotund</em> sum for both,
it might perhaps tempt. I wish to hear from you soon. Everything
is hastening to a dissolution. Winton has taken my stock
(<em>all</em> the horses), but the appraisement came short of what I
expected (not quite £1000). I believe many of the things, live
and dead, were old. Last Monday I went with Mr. Scott to
Weyhill fair, and sold my hops pretty well. The sheep are
moving off very fast. My Corn, a noble stock, will be threshed
out and sold <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous les Yeux de</i> Mr. Luff. The household furniture
will be sold by auction after my departure, but I reserve a great
deal (most assuredly the three pictures) for my house in Town.
Hugonin undertakes the repairs, so that I see nothing which can
prevent my quitting this damned place in about a fortnight or
three Weeks. As soon as I have deposited Mrs. G. at Bath, I
shall be quite my own Master. Adieu.</p>

<p class="head">
Beriton, 21st of October, 1772.
</p>

<p>To quit a subject now become a matter of curiosity, I shall
only say that in this country the Hampshire Gentleman is supposed
to have lett his farm exceedingly high, and that on every
side he hears compliments from the Gentlemen and clamours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
from the Farmers. He did not <em>sneakingly conceal, &amp;c.</em> The
Tenant pays for the seeds, the Fallows were given him, from the
opinion of Hugonin, &amp;c., who agreed that they were very ill
made. But now, hark forward.</p>

<p>The Gosling's impatience will I fear hurry us very unpleasantly.
Their proposal of <em>the New River</em> share would not suit in any
respect. It brings in at least £260 pr. annum, yearly encreasing,
and must, I should think, as freehold be worth thirty years'
purchase; call it £8000. The average (for it varies prodigiously)
of <em>the Copper share</em> is under £100. I cannot think it would sell
for more than £1500. When that was done, instead of a surplus
of Money, I should find myself possessed of two Landed Estates,
with at least £7000 mortgage on one of them, and for a time
totally disabled from buying a house or forming any plans of life,
for a great deal of the farm stock must go towards paying a
variety of middling debts of my most careless Father, which it
was unnecessary to trouble you with. So that scheme will never
answer. I tell my Fleet Street friends that if it will be very
inconvenient to them to allow me another year, or even to stay
the Winter, I must endeavour to get their Mortgage transferred
for a twelfmonth to some other Person, which cannot be done
without trouble and expence. In either case we must act with
vigour. I am so far from chusing to <em>sell under 30 years' purchase</em>
(a bare £20,000 without Manor, &amp;c.) that I think <em>that
a very sorry price: They are still at old Rents. Why cannot we
try an auction of the whole</em> before we divide? <em>I wish to see you,
and think Denham</em> a good place of Rendez-vous: But before I
can get from hence, carry Mrs. G. to Bath, and traverse to Bucks,
it will grow <em>towards the 10th of November</em>. Will that do? To
another man, I should talk nonsense about trouble, obligation,
gratitude, &amp;c. &amp;c. To you, I only say, If I can't meet you at
Denham, <em>take R. Way with you</em>, carve Lenborough and let the
Deed itself serve you for a reward. I have had another letter
from Harris: not a word <em>about Lord V.</em> But he speaks of <em>Mr.
Monkeith</em>, a rich man who liked the Estate, and objected only to
the Poor's tax. I desired he would give him my direction at the
Cocoa Tree, and inform that that objection was removed. Adieu.

<p>As the day draws near and my cares diminish, I think
my hurry encreases&mdash;expect only four lines&mdash;Way's terms I leave
to you, his own appear <em>smart</em> to me.&mdash;An indifferent plan I have
found and will bring with me, but without a measurement.&mdash;If
Way is employed, some deference must I think be paid to his
opinion about the time of sale. The delay is short and the difference
he talks of immense; else I am tired of being a Landlord
at 2&frac34; and as Tenant at 4&frac12; per cent. I told you of my letter to
Fleet Street several weeks ago, refusing the Copper share, and
requesting, if <em>necessary</em>, another year. I have had no answer:
silence I suppose gives consent. If you are in town you might
call. I go from this place for ever, next Thursday. Mrs. G. will
hover about Up-Park and Maple Durham about a fourteen days
longer, till the servants she takes to Bath are recovered from
Inoculation. She insists on my not going with her, as it is so
much later than we first imagined. I go to town directly to look
for a House. Another business, but that is a pleasant one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEARCH FOR HOUSE IN LONDON.</div>

<p>Had I not promised you some account of my proceedings
by to-night's post, I should have deferred it till Tuesday, for
though I have seen much I have done little or nothing. Houses
rise to my enquiry every moment, but where is a perfect house or

(Bentinck Street),<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> but I neither like the offices nor two pair

that he will neither suffer any one to see his house nor quit it

whom I am indebted for three blank Visets, has sent me word of
a house in Argyle Street which I am to see Monday, as well as
another strongly recommended by a Lady in Mrs. Porten's street
(Newman Street). My wise friends check my impatience: my
foolish ones, whom on this occasion I think wiser, encourage it;
however I will do nothing rash.&mdash;Henry means to go down to
Beriton next week; he has left some things there which he fears
will be swept away in the general inundation. Wherever you are,
dear Madam, whether at the proud Up-park or the humble Maple
Durham, I beg my best Compliments to the natives, and the

it will be out of my power to attend without losing sight of my

<p>It pleased my Lord Godolphin to speak by a letter

Since the receipt of your last, he paused, as not knowing whether
he should direct to the top or bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>The stops I have met with about my houses would require
pages instead of lines, but I believe in the end I shall settle in
Bentinck Street. I am at this moment in such hot pursuit of it
that I fear it will be out of my power to attend you to Bath,
without running risks to which I am sure you would be sorry to
expose me. I wish you may find Bath easier or be yourself less
difficult than I have been in London. I hope the best of the
sale, but am sensible that it must in a great measure be left to
the Chapter of Accidents. I will write to Sir Hugh about the
business of Patrick's, which falls in luckily enough. Your ticket
I have enclosed, two days ago it was undrawn. May it be the

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF A FRIEND.</div>

<p>I am called upon to perform a melancholy office, and to
acquaint you with what I am sure you will esteem a loss, whatever
accession of fortune you may derive from it.</p>

<p>Last Sunday sevennight I dined with our friend Mr. Scott at
Mrs. Porten's, and thought him remarkably well and in spirits.
On Thursday I went down into Sussex, and the bad foggy weather
we had in town prevented my calling upon him in the mean time.
He was however already very much out of order, with a bad cold
apparently and a general weakness; his Apothecary however
thought him in no danger, till Dr. Fothergill, who was sent for,
apprehended there was a great deal, though he would not suffer
the people of the House to acquaint him with it. They, on the
Monday 28th instant, thought it incumbent on them to inform Mr.
Oliver, the only friend of his they knew, of his dangerous situation.
Mr. Oliver, on the receipt of their very pressing letter, immediately
dispatched a Post Office Express to Mr. Gibbon of Petersfield,
and the Express (returned by the care of Mr. Bayley and Griffiths
of the Cocoa Tree) reached me last night very late at Sheffield
Place. I came up to Town this morning, but was too late. Your
kinsman and my friend had already terminated a blameless and
happy life by a very easy death about three o'clock Tuesday
afternoon. There was so little appearance of a visible illness
that Dr. Fothergill could only call it a sudden but general decay
of Nature.</p>

<p>After consulting with Sir Stanier Porten<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> we both judged it
would be right to take no steps with regard to his Effects till
you could be informed of what had happened. We went to his
Lodgings this afternoon, and in the presence of the Landlord, the
Apothecary and Mr. Newton's Clerk, we examined every probable
place in search of a Will but found none. All the papers that
seemed of any moment we locked up in a trunk and put our Seal
upon it. The principal one is a bond of £1980 from me to Mr.
Scott only a few days ago to pay off the Clarkes. I heartily wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
that you may be my Creditor. I suppose it will be necessary and
proper for you immediately to examine Mr. Scott's Lodgings at
Bath, which I think was more his regular residence than London.
If no Will should be found anywhere, you are his natural heir,
nor do I understand that it will be necessary for you to come to
town to administer unless you chuse it.</p>

<p>As I do not see that I can be of any immediate use to you, I
propose returning to Sheffield to-morrow for about ten or twelve
days more, but if I am wanted sooner, shall be ready at an hour's
warning either to attend you in London or to execute any of
your directions. Sir Stanier, who sincerely laments our old friend,
proposes to undertake what requires the most immediate care, but
it will be necessary for him to know whether, in case of a Will,
Mr. Scott has left any orders concerning his funeral, or whether you
would chuse to give any particular ones yourself. If the matter
is left to him, we had agreed that it should be in the Parish
Church plain, decent and private. Tuesday next is the last day,
and it would, I should think, be better to send your letter to Sir
Stanier by a Post Office Express under cover to the Earl of
Rochefort, Cleveland Row, which franks the Express.</p>

<p>The nature of the subject and the length of this letter prevents
me from adding any more than that I most sincerely wish you
every happiness of the next and of many succeeding years.</p>

his Vizier, he had not signified to him that the House was agreed
for. I assured him it was; he believed me, and on the morning
after your landing will wait on you with the Inventory and a
short paper. The maid, a most usefull Servant as he says, is

<p>You are clearly in the right. If seldom, long letters:
if short ones, often. 'Tis perfectly equitable, but now to my old
reasons there is a new one added,&mdash;this abominable fine weather
which will not allow me a quiet hour at home, without being
liable to the reproaches of my friends and of my own conscience.
It is the more provoking as it drives me not out of a stinking
Apothecary's, but from my own new clean comfortable dear
house, which I like better every week I pass in it. I now live,
which I never did before, and if it would but rain, should enjoy
that unity of study and society, in which I have always placed
my prospect of happiness. Though I do not find my expences rise
higher than I calculated that they would, I have not yet practised
much of that Economy with which the voice of Fame has complimented
me: but at least I keep (in general) better hours than
I ever yet could bring about in London.</p>

<p>With regard to the Cornish journey. I will fairly lay before
you the state of my mind. As we are often tempted to sacrifice
propriety to inclination, I am afraid that I should have deferred
it another summer in favour of Derbyshire. Your company has
fixed me, but I thought when you was in town we had settled it for
the autumn. If you wish to be early in your visit, I will calculate
that the Autumn begins with August, and will then attend you at
Bath, or if you chuse to go <em>still</em> earlier, I will bring you back;
for I fancy my stay at Port Eliott will hardly be so long as yours.

<p>Holroyd, who begs to be remembered to you, has got a new
scheme of regulating the Tythe-laws, holds meetings, writes
declarations and employs his great soul and his little body entirely
on the business. Mrs. Porten is, I much fear, in a very bad way:
her old complaint, but the fits more violent and more frequent.
We shall not possess her long.</p>

<p>This morning, the fact is certain, an Address was delivered to
Lord B[ellamont] from the Grand Jury of the County of Dublin,
thanking him for his proper and spirited behaviour. Incomparable
Hibernians! A Judicial Body appointed to maintain
and execute the Laws publicly applaud a man for having broke
them.</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>Your kind letter and just reproaches, instead of making
me do immediately what I had resolved to do every post-night
for a fortnight before, put off my letters two or three days
longer. The Snail of Love-lane, I saw this morning, and he tells
me that he had sent you a satisfactory explanation of his conduct;
if it appears otherwise to you, and that his delays are still inconvenient
to you, I beg that you would draw upon me, and hope
you are persuaded that, as I have two hundred pounds in Fleet
Street, you are welcome to one of them.</p>

<p>With Holroyd's assistance, who is determined to extricate me
out of all my troubles, the sale of Lenborough by auction at
Buckingham is fixed for the 24th of this month. He goes down
with me, and the Estate has been carefully divided into four lots,
rising successively in value above each other, so that, if any parts
should remain upon my hands a while longer, they will be the
best. These precautions are requisite in the present scarcity of
money, which gives me little hopes of selling the whole together,
and even the sanguine Holroyd is apprehensive that I shall be
obliged to buy it in again and provide for the mortgage by some
other measures, at least of the procrastinating kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A HAPPY MAN.</div>

<p>Were it not for these worldly cares, I should be a very happy
man. I never formed any great schemes of avarice, ambition or
vanity: and all the notions I ever formed of a London life in my
own house, and surrounded by my books, with a due mixture of
study and society, are fully realised. I have seen the Eliotts
several times, and think he and I take to one another very well
this year. They both express great pleasure at the thoughts of
seeing us in Cornwall. I shall be glad to know whether the time
I mentioned will suit. I am obliged to you for your invitation to
Bath, and am lost in admiration at the size of your house, which
enables you to spare a bed-chamber and drawing-room; tho' after
all, I can offer you the same apartment in my little Palace, which
is absolutely the best house in London. The Waste-coats are
<em>sincerely</em> pretty, without gratitude or compliment. The Madeira
I have got from Oliver; it is incomparable, but saddled with nine
or ten pounds due for cellarage ever since Mr. Scott's arrival in
England. Where was the Rum, for Oliver knows nothing about
it? Apropos the Beriton pictures; should you think it worth
while to frame and put them up at Bath? They will not suit my
rooms and will be soon spoilt in a Lumber-room. If you do not
chuse them, I believe I shall let them take their choice at
Christie's, though I find by a very good painter's opinion that we
much over-rated their value. My compliments to the Goulds, &amp;c.
Poor Mrs. Porten has long and frequent attacks, but her spirits
are still good.</p>

the hounds go out again next Friday. They are in high spirits;

Holroyd accompanied me to Buckingham in his way to Ireland.
The auction was very cold, as all auctions are at present, and the
highest sum that was bid was £19,000 by an Agent of Lord
Temple. By the advice of H., my faithfull friend and Minister,
I was immoveably fixed at £20,000, which, <em>all things considered</em>,
is not amiss. The Agent had gone to the utmost of his instructions,

<p>At length the Buckinghamshire transaction is at an
end. Lord T., after tormenting himself or me to very little
purpose, absolutely refused to give more than £19,000, but a Mr.
Lovegrove, an Oxfordshire man, who has made his own fortune,
applied to Mr. Richard Way, viewed the Estate, and after a long
altercation agreed with me at £20,000, and an excellent purchase
he has made, though the weight of interest, the importunity of
the Goslings and the scarcity of money oblige me to be satisfied
with what I have been able to get for it. By Michaelmas I shall
be a clear, though a poor man; since, when I have discharged the
Mortgage and cancelled the bond which I gave Mr. Scott for the
Clarke's money, very little indeed that I can call my own will
remain of that noble estate. My only comfort, and a very cold
one, is that, though these incumbrances must be paid at my
expence, they were not contracted by my imprudence. But to
leave these melancholy reflections on a subject which is now
irretrievable.</p>

<p>Newton will I believe send you down the Deed engrossed
in a day or two. The confidence, Dear Madam, which you express
in me, pleases without surprizing me, and I hope the business will
be settled to your satisfaction. Apropos you forget your half-year,

to draw upon me, or shall I send you the money in Bank Notes?</p>

<p>By what I can collect at Spring Gardens, Mrs. E. will go into
Cornwall in a few days, but will not pass through Bath in her

<div class="sidenote">A VISIT FROM DEYVERDUN.</div>

<p>You will excuse my silence when I tell you I have a
friend with me, who takes up the greatest part of my last Friday
se'nnight. Mr. d'Eyverdun most agreeably surprized me by
walking into my library. His young Lord Chesterfield has come
over for a few weeks, and as he went down almost immediately
with Lovel Stanhope to the Duke of Chandos, my friend has
established himself in my house during the too short period of his
visit. You may easily suppose how much I think he embellishes
my little habitation. I carry him about, we converse, read and
write, and are together almost every hour in the day without the
least constraint on either side. The town is growing empty and
what is commonly called dull, but with such a companion and my
books you will believe me when I say that I do not regret the
pleasures of the winter. Even the latter would be sufficient, and
were it not to see you, the charms of Cornwall would scarcely
induce me to leave London in one of the hottest summers that we
have felt for a great while.</p>

<p>The Eliott family is moving away by different detachments.
Mrs. Eliott and William, Miss and Edward have already reached
Cornwall, but it is impossible to discover when the Lord of St.
Germains means to follow them. I have sounded him, and by his
dark equivocal hints can only learn that he is certainly not upon
the point of his departure. His slowness will I fear retard our
intended visit and derange my subsequent operations. He will
surely not be in Cornwall till the beginning of next month, and
the decent time we must give him to settle himself will soon
carry us to the end of it. I will send the earliest intelligence I
can obtain of his motions, for I know by experience that a state
of suspense even in trifles is painfull.</p>

<p>I beg ten thousand pardons for not being dead, as I

rather live in Bentinck Street, attainted and convicted of the sin
of laziness, than enjoy your applause either at old Nick's or even

honor with my correspondance a wild Barbarian of the bogs of
Erin? Had the Natives intercepted my letter, the terrors occasioned
by such unknown Magic characters might have been
fatal to you. But now you have escaped the fury of their
Hospitality, and are arrived amongst a Cee-vi-leezed Nation, I
may venture to renew my intercourse.</p>

<p>You tell me of a long list of Dukes, Lairds, and Chieftains of
Renown to whom you are recommended; were I with you, I
should prefer one David to them all. When you are at Edinburgh,
I hope you will not fail to visit the Stye of that fattest of Epicurus's
Hogs,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and inform yourself whether there remains no hope

<div class="sidenote">LONDON A DELICIOUS SOLITUDE.</div>

<p>Boodle's and Atwood's are now no more. The last stragglers,
and Clarke in the rear of all, are moved away to their several
castles; and I now enjoy, in the midst of London, a delicious
solitude. My Library, Kensington Gardens, and a few parties
with new acquaintance who are chained to London, (among whom
I reckon Goldsmith and Sir Joshua Reynolds,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>) fill up my time,
and the monster <em>Ennui</em> preserves a very respectfull distance. By
the bye, your friends Batt, Sir John [Russel], and Lascelles, dined
with me one day before they set off; for I sometimes give the
prettiest little dinners in the world. But all this happiness draws
near its conclusion. About the 16th of this month Mr. Eliot
carries me away, and after picking up Mrs. G. at Bath, sets me
down at Port Eliot. There I shall certainly remain six weeks,
or, in other words, to the end of September. My future motions,
whether to London, Derbyshire, or a longer stay in Cornwall,
(pray is not "motion for stay" rather in the Hibernian style?)
will depend on the life of Port Eliot, the time of the meeting of
Parliament, and perhaps the impatience of Mr. Lovegrove, Lord
of Lenborough.</p>

<p>One of my pleasures in town I forgot to mention, the unexpected
visit of d'Eyverdun, who accompanies his young Lord
(very young indeed!) on a two months' tour to England. He
took the opportunity of the Earl's going down to the Duke
of Chandos's, to spend a fortnight (nor do I recollect in my life
a more pleasant one) in Bentinck Street. They are now gone
together into Yorkshire, and I think it doubtfull whether I shall
see him again before his return to Leipsic. It is a melancholy
reflection that while one is plagued with acquaintance at the
corner of every street, real friends should be separated from each
other by unsurmountable bars, and obliged to catch at a few
transient moments of interview. I desire that you and My Lady
(whom I most respectfully greet) would take your share of that
very new and acute observation; not so large a share, indeed,
as my Swiss friend, since Nature and fortune give <em>us</em> more
frequent opportunities of being together. You cannot expect
News from a Desert, and such is London at present. The papers
give you the full harvest of public intelligence; and I imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>

transactions of the polite, the amorous, and the marrying World.
The great Pantomime of Portsmouth was universally admired;
and I am angry at my own laziness in neglecting an excellent
opportunity of seeing it. Foote has given us the 'Bankrupt,'<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> a

<p>*By this time you have surely finished your Tour, touched
at Edinburgh, where you found a Letter, which you have not
answered, and are now contemplating the beauties of the Weald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of Sussex. I shall demand a long and particular account of your
peregrinations, but will excuse it till we meet; and for the
present, expect only a short memorandum of your health and
situation, together with that of my much-honoured friend Mrs.
Abigail Holroyd. A word, too, if you please, concerning Father
and Sister; to the latter I enclose a receipt from Mrs. G., who
is now with me at Port Eliot.</p>

<p>Blind as you accuse me of being to the beauties of Nature, I
am wonderfully pleased with this country. Of her three dull
notes, <em>Ground</em>, <em>Plants</em>, and <em>Water</em>, Cornwall possesses the first
and last in very high perfection. Think of a hundred solitary
streams peacefully gliding between amazing Clifs on one side
and rich meadows on the other, gradually swelling by the aid of
the Tide into noble rivers, successively losing themselves in each
other, and all at length terminating in the Harbour of Plymouth,
whose broad expanse is irregularly <em>dotted</em> with two-and-forty Line
of battle Ships. In <em>Plants</em>, indeed, we are deficient; and though
all the Gentlemen now attend to Posterity, the country will for
a long time be very naked. We have spent several days agreeably
enough in little parties; but in general our time rolls away in
an equal kind of insipidity. Our civil Landlord possesses neither
a pack of hounds, nor a stable of running horses, nor a large
farm, nor a good library. The last only would interest me; but
it is singular that a Man of fortune, who chuses to pass nine
months of the year in the country, should have none of them.*
One possession he has indeed most truly desirable; but I much

However, I desire, and one always finds time for what one really
desires, to visit Sheffield Place before the end of October, should
it only be for a few days. I know several houses where I am
invited to think myself at home, but I know no other where I
seem inclined to accept of the invitation. I forgot to tell you,

bleeding hearts, and an approaching daughter-in-law, is all very
agreeable Romance. A pair of very tolerable eyes, I must confess,
made their appearance at Sheffield, and what is more extraordinary
were accompanied by good sense and good humour, without one
grain of affectation. Yet, still I am <em>indifferent</em>, and she is <em>poor</em>;
remove those two little obstacles: and Miss H.'s intelligence
might have some foundation. I came only four or five days ago
from Sussex: the pleasing consciousness of being of some use
and comfort to my friend, who is greatly mended, kept me there
much longer than I intended. I am now pursuing the conclusion
of Lenborough; some entertaining delays of the law have driven
us a little beyond the appointed time, but I flatter myself we
shall finish either before or immediately after the Holydays.</p>

that <em>he happened</em> to have £5000 in long annuities, and begged
he might be permitted to supply the deficiency. How generous!
Yet there are people who say the money only stood in his name.&mdash;"My

a Verdict for our Client, his Cause was but a bad one. It is a very
confused Miscellany of several Plays and Tales; sets out brilliantly
enough, but as we advance the Plot grows thicker, the Wit
thinner, till the lucky fall of the Curtain preserves us from total
Chaos.</p>

<p>Besides this general apology for my delay, I have another on this

absent on a visit to Lord Craven. He is now returned, and thus he

<p>4. That from Parole and written evidence, they should determine
whether the small tythes were warranted, and in case they
were, what abatement should be made to the purchaser for a
doubtfull or imperfect Title to them.</p>

<p>5. As it may be apprehended that Lovegrove, if their Decision
was unfavourable to him, might direct his quibbles to some of
the many other inexhaustible resources of the Law, it is submitted
to Mr. H., whether the whole business, with regard to the general
title, great tythes, time and obligation to compleating the purchase,
had not better be left to the final award of three Gentlemen

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

both the Storers, Hodges, a Steward of Lady Albemarle's, her
first love, and half the town besides. A Meeting of Horneck's
friends assembled about a Week ago, to consult of the best
method of acquainting him with his frontal honours. Edmund
Burke was named as the Orator, and communicated the transaction
in a most Eloquent speech.</p>

have the most delicate Appetite, was accustomed, in her own

Porter till she was dead drunk. Horneck is abused by the
Albemarle family, has been bullied by Storer, and can prove
himself a Cornuto, to the satisfaction of every one but a Court
of Justice. O Rare Matrimony!*</p>

<p><em>Lenborough.</em>&mdash;Last Sunday morning I saw R. Way in Bentinck
Street. He had seen Lovegrove both in country and in Town,
but it seems very difficult to make any thing of him. Way
pressed him to call upon me or Newton to settle the preliminaries
of the Arbitration. He replied, that without Matthews he could
do nothing. Matthews on the other hand, when Newton wrote
to him, said, that he could be of no use in town till the conveyances
were ready for signing. Such damned shuffling. Way
promised to call on Palmer, who in general has accepted the
office of Arbitrator, and get him to write to Lovegrove to
convince him of the necessity of settling things previously as
to the object of the Arbitration, and penalty of the parties. On
his return into the country he will see Lovegrove and Matthews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and assure them how strongly I <em>appeared</em> resolved for chancery,
if I found any farther delay or difficulty. Would it were over!</p>

<p><em>Beriton.</em>&mdash;Mrs. Lee, on receiving Andrews's letter, wrote to
him to desire he would send it up to me (as it seemed written
without my knowledge), and to press that I would disclose my
real intention about repairs, maintaining that according to Law,
Honor and my former declarations, I am obliged to fulfil them,
hinting however, that if I can settle the business with Winton,
Mrs. Lee desires to hear no more about it. On that ground I
can direct a most excellent letter to Hugonin, which may tame
the monster without making it desperate.</p>

<p>*<em>America.</em>&mdash;Had I wrote Saturday night, as I once intended,
Fire and Sword, Oaths of Allegiance and high treason tryed in
England, in consequence of the refusal, would have formed my
letter. Lrd. North, however, opened a most lenient prescription
last night; and the utmost attempts towards a new settlement
seemed to be no more than investing the Governor with a greater
share of executive power, nomination of civil officers, (Judges,
however, for life,) and some regulations of Juries. The Boston
Port bill passed the Lords last night; some lively conversation,
but no division.</p>

<p><em>Bentinck-street.</em>&mdash;Rose Fuller the Great was against the Boston
port Bill, and against his niece's going to Boodle's masquerade.
He was laughed at in the first instance, but succeeded in the
second. Sappho and Fanny very indifferent (as Mama says)
about going. They seem of a different opinion.* This morning
d'Eyverdun arrived: When you consider him, morning walks,
dinners, Evenings, the general idleness of town, and my peculiar
employment, you must not swear, if I am not very punctual.
Adieu. Duty to My Lady, and love to Maria. I hope the

<p>My Bucks affair is not settled, and I much fear that it
will occasion me more trouble than I at first expected. Mr.
Lovegrove's difficulty&mdash;not to call it by a harsher name&mdash;turns on
a point of fact not of law, and is so very unreasonable that he
must be condemned either in the more eligible way of arbitration
(which I hope will be settled) or in the Court of Chancery, should
I be reduced to the sad necessity of calling it to my aid. The
uneasy suspense that it has kept and will keep me in for some
time, defers my intended visit to Bath, and disappoints Mrs.
Porten, as well as myself, of a pleasure which we had assured
ourselves of enjoying.</p>

<p>I am at present engaging in two other tasks of a very different
nature, the receiving one friend and the comforting another.
d'Eyverdun arrived in Bentinck Street last Tuesday, and will I
believe go abroad again in about a month with Lord Middleton.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>

a very tame bear, and if we can fix a quiet annuity, he may after
this Tour enjoy ease and independence for the rest of his life.
Upon recollection this paragraph must seem very unintelligible to
you, as I do not believe that I mentioned to you, his having been

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear H.</span>,
</p>

<p>*At length I am a little more at liberty. Clarke went
out of town this morning. Instead of going directly into Derbyshire,
where he would have been overwhelmed with visits, &amp;c. he
has taken his Sister, brother, and aunts, to a little Villa near
Farnham, in which he has the happiness of having no neighbourhood.
If my esteem and friendship for Godfrey had been capable
of any addition, it would have been very much encreased by the
manner in which he felt and lamented his father's death.* Incredible
as it sounds to the generality of sons, and as it ought to
sound to most fathers, he considered the old Gentleman as a
friend. *He is now in very different circumstances than before;
instead of an easy and ample allowance, he has taken possession
of a great Estate, with low rents and high incumbrances. I hope
the one may make amends for the other: under your conduct I
am sure they would, and I have freely offered him your assistance,
in case he should wish to apply for it.</p>

<p>In the mean time I must not forget my own affairs, which
seem to be covered with inextricable perplexity. R. Way, as I
mentioned about a Century ago, promised to see Lovegrove and
his Attorney, and to oil the wheels of the Arbitration. As yet
I have not heard from him. I have some thoughts of writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
<em>myself</em> to the Jockey, stating the various steps of the affair, and
offering him, with polite firmness, the <em>immediate</em> choice of Chancery
or Arbitration.</p>

<p>For the time, however, I forget all these difficulties, in the
present enjoyment of Deyverdun's Company; and I glory in
thinking, that, although my house is small, it is just of a sufficient
size to hold my real friends, male and <em>female</em>; among the latter
My Lady holds the very first place.*</p>

<p>Apropos of My Lady, Harry Hobart the other day gave me a
<em>very pleasing hint</em>, which he received from his wife. If there is
any foundation for it, I sincerely congratulate you.</p>

<p>*We are all quiet.&mdash;American business is suspended, and almost
forgot. The other day we had a brisk report of a Spanish War.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
It was said they had taken one of the Leeward Islands. It since
turns out that we are the Invaders, but the invasion is trifling.*
Batt and Sir John not returned. Are you alone? I have
received another dozen of handkerchiefs, and you, by this time,
have got your books and silver spoons, which Caplin has sent by
the coach. Adieu.</p>

<p>*<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien obligé non</i> (at present) for your invitation. I wish My
Lady and you would come up to our Masquerade the 3rd of May.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>

a bad Correspondent, I much fear that I shall every week become
a more hardened Sinner. Besides the occasional obstructions of
<em>Clarke and Deyverdun</em>, I must entreat you to consider, with your
usual candour, 1. The aversion to Epistolary Conversation, which
it has pleased the Demon to implant in my nature. 2. That I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
am a very fine Gentleman, a Subscriber to the Masquerade,

and, in truth, when I am writing a page, I not only think it
a sufficient reason of delay, but even consider myself as writing
to you, and that much more to the purpose than if I were sending
you the tittle tattle of the town, of which indeed there is none
stirring. With regard to America, the Minister seems moderate,
and the House obedient.</p>

<p>Hugonin's last letter, by some very <em>unaccountable accident</em>, had
never reached me; so that yours, in every instance, amazed me.
I immediately wrote him groans and approbation. Winton, however,
gives me very little uneasiness. I see that he is a bully, and
that I have a stick. But the cursed business of Lenborough, in
the midst of Study, Dissipation, and friendship, at times almost
distracts me.* R. Way seems to have done nothing with the
Jockey, (who indeed is as strange as Winton himself, singular
luck enough I have had) nor have I yet ventured to cross the
Rubicon by writing to him. <em>I wish your journey here</em> and into
Oxfordshire was to take <em>place soon</em>, and yet I hardly know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
you could do for me. *I am surely in a worse condition than
before I sold the Estate, and what distresses me is, that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">His ego
nec metas rerum, nec tempora pono</i>.</p>

<p>Both Deyverdun and Clarke wish to be remembered to you.
The former, who has more taste for the Country than &mdash;&mdash;,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
could wish to visit you, but he sets out in a few days for the
Continent <em>with Lord M[iddleton]</em>.* Your letter for the latter
was immediately mentioned and very kindly received. He is
now at Aldershot with his family, and on this <em>occasion only</em> I
write to him almost every post, as I am this moment preparing
to do. Therefore Adieu.</p>

<p>When I already began to chide my own laziness, a little
gentleman from Bath brought me a very elegant proof of your
kind attention to me. The little man himself I could not see, as
I happened to be abroad twice when he called upon me; but I had
the pleasure of hearing through him that Mr. Eliot was quite or
almost recovered. I beg you would assure him and Mrs. Eliot
how much I rejoice in the news.</p>

<p>Clarke has now been at his house near Farnham some days.
Next week he is obliged to visit town on some business, and
expresses a violent intention of carrying me down with him.
The pleasure of being of service to an afflicted friend, may make
even the country agreeable. In that case I should leave Deyverdun
in possession of Bentinck Street, though I should grumble at
giving up any part of his short stay.</p>

<p>I have likewise seen another heir, younger and much more
cheerful than Clarke, though extremely decent, I mean Sir Harry
Fetherstone.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> At present everything carries the appearance of

We have a great deal of money and consequently of taste. Flying
bridges, transparent temples and eighteen thousand lamps in the
Dome are the general subject of conversation. For my own part
I subscribe, but am very indifferent about it. A few friends and
a great many books may entertain me, but I think fifteen hundred

<p>*Last night was the Triumph of Boodle's. Our Masquerade
cost two thousand Guineas; a sum that might have fertilized a
Province, (I speak in your own style,) vanished in a few hours,
but not without leaving behind it the fame of the most splendid
and elegant Fête that was perhaps ever given in a seat of the
Arts and Opulence. It would be as difficult to describe the magnificence
of the Scene, as it would be easy to record the humour
of the night. The one was above, the other below, all relation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
I left the Pantheon about five this morning, rose at ten, took a
good Walk, and returned home to a more rational entertainment of
Batt, Sir John [Russel], and Lascelles, who dined with me. They
have left me this moment; and were I to enumerate the things
said of Sheffield, it would form a much longer letter than I have
any inclination to write. Let it suffice, that Sir John means to
pass in Sussex the interval of the two terms. Every thing, in a
word, goes on very pleasantly, except the terrestrial business of
Lenborough. Last Saturday se'nnight I wrote to Richard, to press
him to see Lovegrove, and urge the Arbitration. He has not
<em>condescended</em> to answer me. All is a dead Calm, sometimes more
fatal than a storm. For God's sake send me Advice. I seem to
be in a much worse situation than before I agreed with him.*</p>

<p>Instead of censuring my indolence (though you might as
usual do it with very just reason), listen to a tale of wonders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISS HESTER GIBBON.</div>

<p>On Sunday last, when my servant came to the place where I
had dined, with the carriage, he told me that Mrs. Gibbon was
come to town, had sent to Bentinck Street and wished to see me
that evening. It appeared somewhat singular that you should
have run up to town without giving me any notice, and somewhat
unkind that you should not have made Bentinck Street your Inn.&mdash;But,
*guess my surprize when a further enquiry discovered to
me that it was not Mrs. Gibbon of Bath, but Mrs. Gibbon of
Northamptonshire. I immediately went to Surrey Street where
she lodged, but though it was no more than half an hour after
nine, the Saint had finished her evening devotions and was already
retired to rest. Yesterday morning (by appointment) I breakfasted
with her at eight o'clock, dined with her to-day at two in Newman
Street, and am just returned from setting down. She is in truth
a very great curiosity, her dress and figure exceed everything we
had at the Masquerade. Her language and ideas belong to the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
century. However, in point of religion she was rational, that is
to say silent. I do not believe that she asked a single question or
said the least thing concerning it. To me she behaved with great
cordiality, and in her way expressed a great regard.* In a light of
interest, however, her regard is of little consequence to me; if I
may judge from her appearance her life is a better one than mine.
Please to communicate a proper part of this intelligence to our
Cornish friends. She expressed the utmost disappointment at not
finding Mrs. Eliot and her children in town. I am sorry to hear
that we have less chance than ever of seeing them since Hams,
Cheeses and my little friend John<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> are gone down to Bath.</p>

<p>My knowledge of Mr. Eliot's disinclination to writing has
prevented me from giving him the trouble of an answer. My
despair of equalling the elegant raillery of the Goddess has kept
me silent on that quarter likewise. Lazyness you will say never
wants an excuse.</p>

<p>As the Summer advances (and sorry I am to say that it advances
much faster than my Bucks business), I now fear that Mrs. P. and
myself must defer our Bath journey to the latter season of the
Year. There would however be a way which would bring us
together much sooner. You have been long and impatiently
expected at Sheffield Place, where I propose to pass at least the
month of July. From Charles Street to Bentinck Street it is a
pleasant drive; from Bentinck Street to Sheffield Place little more
than a morning walk. Mrs. P. tells me that she has just wrote to
you. She ought to go to a Masquerade once a year. Did you think
her such a girl?</p>

he would ill deserve it. I do not wish to discover how many days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
(I am afraid I ought to use another word) have elapsed since the
date of my last, or even of your last letter; and yet such is the
sluggish nature of the beast, that I am afraid nothing but
the arrival of Mrs. Bonfoy, and the expectation of Mr. Eliot, could
have rouzed me from my Lethargy. The Lady gave me great
satisfaction, by her general account of your health and spirits, but
communicated some uneasiness, by the mention of a little encounter,
in the style of one of Don Quixote's, but which proved, I hope, as
trifling as you at first imagined it. For my own part, I am well
in mind and body, busy with my Books, (which may perhaps
produce something next year, either to tire or amuse the World,)
and every day more satisfied with my present mode of life, which
I always believed was calculated to make me happy. My only
remaining uneasiness is Lenborough, which is not terminated.
By Holroyd's advice, I rather try what may be obtained by
a little more patience, than rush at once into the horrors of
Chancery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR STANIER PORTEN.</div>

<p>But let us talk of something else.* You remember surely Mrs.
Hobson (Miss Comarque). She is just returned to England under
a different name. She is now Madame la Baronne de Bavois. Her
second husband is an old Swiss Officer about seventy, a man of
family, but with as little money as character, who most probably
married her for a fortune which he now begins to discover was
spent to his hands. They talk of leaving England very soon, and
fixing themselves in some cheap Provincial town in the South of
France. The Baronne is more ridiculous, and will I fear be more
miserable than ever. Mrs. Porten, out of regard to the laws of
Hospitality, gave them a dinner last Sunday, &amp; insists on my
doing the same to-day, and her brother Sunday next. She grows
younger every day, but Sir Stanier much older. *You remember, I
think in Newman Street, a good agreeable Woman, Miss Wybolt.
The under Secretary<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> is seriously in love with her, and seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
uneasy that his precarious situation precludes him from happiness.
We shall soon see which will get the better, Love or reason. I bet
three to two on love.*</p>

<p>I cannot find your last letter (a sad memento); did not
you ask me with whom Deyverdun was gone abroad? with young
Lord Middleton. Lady Fetherston (as they are to return next
spring) is mad to get him, but I should fancy Sir Harry must
be consulted&mdash;I hear confusedly of strange Revolutions in the
Gould family.</p>

<p>Next week I go to Sheffield place. Holroyd, who passes a few
days with me, was sincerely concerned to hear that you had no
thoughts of the Journey this summer. His Father, I find, has
had a violent attack.</p>

<p class="head">
Bentinck Street, August 6th, 1774.
</p>

<p>With regard to your influencing the Jury, I am convinced
that B. is in the right. Out of twelve Jurymen, I suppose six
to be incapable of understanding the question, three afraid of
giving offence, and two more who will not take the trouble of
thinking. Remains one who has sense, courage and application.
Ergo B. is in the right. But as he has <em>no right</em> on this occasion
to be in the right, and as you were <em>not Foreman</em>, I am totally
against <em>your committing</em> yourself with such a fellow, giving him
anything under your hand or <em>permitting him to publish your
letters</em>. If <em>it be really true</em> that you were mistaken as to the date
of the Defamation, you have gone further than perhaps you might
have done in the article of damages, but as I still think you
committed no injustice, I cannot see that the Jury, much less
any individual of it, owe him any reparation. Considering the
profession of the two men, very high damages were surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
required for the accusation of so scandalous a crime, which was
certainly groundless since it was <em>afterwards</em> disproved in a Court
of Justice. What you supposed to be the case (and by the bye
I would in a polite letter ask the question of the Judge) was no
more than an aggravation, and an aggravation too of a public
rather than a private nature, consequently relating rather to
punishment than to damages.&mdash;Upon the whole I disapprove of
your corresponding with B., who seems capable of any rascally
trick. Nothing that he can publish will affect your character,
especially in an affair where it is well known that you had neither
interest nor passion to mislead you. However if you think
differently, or find yourself too far engaged with him, your letter
is proper and guarded.</p>

<p>You make me very uneasy by a part of your last; pray
send me a speedy, and if you can a favorable account of
Dr. H[eberden]'s visit.&mdash;She has been so well a great while.&mdash;Clarke
is now in the Country,&mdash;Aldershot. I heard from him
yesterday. His health there has been various, and is not I fear
quite settled. I break off to get into my chaise for Twickenham.
People may talk of the town's being empty in September, my
only complaint is the thickness of my engagements. I have not
by many degrees been so diligent as I intended. I have conversed
with Cadell,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and find him ready and even willing. He proposes
next March (if I am prepared) and 750 Copies. <em>Deliberabimus.</em>
The snails of the Law are copying the Tythe deed, and we shall
soon see the effect of it. Hugonin's letter I have not yet read,
it is only a week since it was received, no hurry. I believe I
must goad Gilbert in his enquiries, in case you cannot do it
without giving room to surmises.</p>

<p>Since my last we have had an alarm, a very terrible one
indeed. On Sunday Clarke was better than I had yet seen him,
and said that he felt himself getting well apace. He slept several
hours in the night, but about five o'clock the Monday morning,
he was seized with a fit so very violent that it totally deprived
him of his speech and almost of his senses; a blister and plaister
to his feet were immediately applied, and Turton was called in
to consult with Dr. Thomas his ordinary Physician.</p>

<p>They both judged him in the most imminent danger, and
particularly were alarmed by a numbness (which he complained
of as soon as he could speak), and which was the same symptom
as had proved the forerunner of his father's apoplexy. He
recovered however from his fit, and even from the immediate
consequences of it sooner than could have been expected, was
perfectly sensible last night, and this morning appears even
chearful and easy. But his Physicians still think him in danger
of a Relapse, and to his friends the prospect is still shocking.
You will easily forgive me for not writing on any other subject.

<h3><em>To J. B. Holroyd, Esq.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
August the 20th, 1774.
</p>

<p>I begin with what I am sure will interest you the most,
notwithstanding your own schemes, I mean the state of Clarke's
health. It is surprisingly well, as likewise his spirits, both far
better than by his own account they have been for many months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
The recovery is indeed perfect; may it be lasting. But his
Doctors have still their fears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NEW MAN FOR THE COUNTY.</div>

<p>Now to your designs, I have turned them on every side and
will give you my opinion as distinctly as so very slight a knowledge
of your county will permit.</p>

<p>1. I cannot yet think you ripe for a county member.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Five
years are very little to remove the obvious objection of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novus
homo</i>, and of all objections it is perhaps the most formidable, as it
rouzes the foolish pride and envy of all the animals&mdash;bears, hogs,
asses and Rhinoceroses who have slept in the country for some
generations. To these only (who by the courtesy of England are
called Gentlemen) are you as yet known, and by these you will
never be liked. Seven more years of an active life will spread
your fame among the great body of Freeholders at large, and to
them you may one day offer yourself on the most honourable
footing, that of a candidate whose real services to the County
have deserved and will repay the favor which he then solicits.
You must recollect, too, some very good reason you gave me
yourself, why the attempt might be more convenient and the
success more desirable seven years hence than at present.</p>

<p>2. Consider that you are rising in rebellion against an establishment
which, however feeble, always fights with very great
advantages. When a vacancy happens&mdash;either by death or
resignation, any Gentleman who thinks himself qualified has a
natural right to offer his services, and as he may succeed without
envy, so he may retreat without shame. Your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prise d'armes</i> must
hurt you, I think, if you were not victorious. <em>People grumble</em>;
Englishmen love to grumble, and are satisfied with having done
it. You see many obstacles. Goodwood<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> reluctant, Ld. Ash.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
hostile, the green plumb<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> probably interested, and a large previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
subscription backed by strong interest. As to the multitude,
you cannot conceive the effect of the magic sounds, <em>disturbing the
peace of the County</em>.</p>

<p>3. To all this you oppose 'hur own if hur can catch hur.' But
I should much distrust the strength of your desired Ally.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
Unpleasant recollections, a stately and supposed proud behaviour,
a solitary life, since he never troubles himself with County
meetings, must, I should apprehend, very greatly diminish his
popularity, and conceal those abilities which you so justly value,
but which few of your country boors are qualified to understand
or esteem. Is the mere Dorset<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> interest a <em>commanding one</em>?</p>

<p>4. You say that you are not apprehensive at Lewes of a
horrid silence or hiss. Perhaps not. But should you be so
easily satisfied? Who do you design should propose you at the
nomination meeting? for much depends on that, not only as to
the hopes of success, but even the dignity and propriety of the
declaration. The person to move and the person to second it
(for both are necessary) should be distinguished in the County,
either by character or property; Minden<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> would certainly do very
well. You will tell me that your connection is not sufficiently
formed to request such a favour. But is not that a proof that
things are yet unripe?</p>

<p>5. If you proceed, which upon the whole, I strongly dissuade,
I would (in case of a favourable answer from Minden) immediately
epistolize or rather visit Goodwood. I would declare my
intention of taking the <em>sense</em> (if any can be found) of the General
meeting, requesting that if it should prove favourable to Lord
G. L[ennox] and myself, we might previously agree to advertise
and act together. A refusal would permit you to retreat with
honour, consent would enable you to advance with vigour and
confidence, and even the proposal would place you on the <em>much
desired footing</em> of a future Candidate. After all, for God's sake
remember the expence, and do not trust your fortune and your
passions to the danger of a Contest.</p>

<p>Duane after a very long delay has at last given his opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
concerning the tythes, and the opinion is favourable. He thinks
the title, <em>clear, safe, and even compellable</em>, but directs that the
original grants of James the first's time should be searched for
in the proper office and copied. This will be attended with some
expence, but it cannot be avoided. Newton, whom I saw to-day,
writes by this post to Matthews and sends him the opinion. So
that in a short time we may I think either come to an amicable
conclusion, or meet them in arms on <em>firm ground</em>. I hear nothing
of the insurance. Cream cheese will be welcome.&mdash;To my Lady
and the monstrous Maria, <em>salut</em>.</p>

sense can be embraced is, without delay, to bring My Lady to
B[entinck] S[treet], where you may inhabit two or three nights,
and have any advice (Turton, Heberden, &amp;c.) which the town
may afford, in a case that most assuredly ought not to be trifled

strongly in the same sentiments. There can be no apprehension
of late hours, &amp;c. as none of Mrs. H.'s raking acquaintance are in
town.* As to Burtenshaw's Manifesto, I can form no judgement
of an imperfect fragment, except that it appears to me very
artful. The case relative to you I have reconsidered, but find no
reason to alter my opinion.</p>

<p>1st. An answer on your side cannot be necessary, since he had
no right to single you out.</p>

<p>2dly. It cannot be expedient, since a fellow of so much passion
and cunning will surely in the end either provoke you or entangle
you in an unworthy contest. If however you have given him
hopes of an answer, I would positively declare to him that it should
be the last, and that no consideration should tempt me to a reply.</p>

<p>You give me no account of the Works. When do you inhabit

<div class="sidenote">OFFER OF A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p>*It is surely infinite condescension for a Senator to bestow his
attention on the affairs of a Juryman. A Senator? Yes, sir, at
last <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod nemo promittere Divum auderet, volvenda dies en! attulit
ultro.</i>* About ten days ago Eliot spent an hour with me, talked
sensibly of his will, and his children, and requested that I would
be Executor to the one and Guardian to the other. I consented
to accept an office which indeed I consider as an essential duty of
social life. We parted. *Yesterday morning, about half an hour
after seven, as I was destroying an army of Barbarians, I heard a
double rap at the door, and my Cornish friend was soon introduced.
After some idle conversation he told me, that if I was
desirous of being in Parliament, he had an <em>independent</em> seat very
much at my service.* You may suppose my answer, but my
satisfaction was a little damped when he added that the expence
of the election would amount to about £2400, &amp; that he thought
it reasonable that we should share it between us. I paused, and,
recovering myself, hinted something of Parental extravagance,
and filial narrowness of circumstances and want of ready money,
and that I must beg a short delay to consider whether I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
with prudence accept of his intended favour, on which I set the
highest value. His answer was obliging, that he should be very
much mortified if a few hundred pounds should prevent it, and
that he had been afraid to offend me by offering it on less equal
terms. His behaviour gave me courage to propose an expedient,
which was instantly accepted with cordiality and eagerness, that
when his second son John (who is now thirteen) came of age I
would restore to him my proportion of the money.</p>

<p>I am not disposed to build Castles in Spain, but I think my
conduct prudent. Before that time my own honest industry or
the deaths of old Ladies <em>may</em> make me a richer man: or else I
can offer (some years hence) a fair and liberal bargain, that I will
settle Beriton on John, in case I have no children, with the
proviso that on the birth of a child, I shall pay him the money
with legal interest. The agreement will be easy for me, and
advantageous to them. *This is a fine prospect opening upon
me, and if next spring I should take my seat, and publish my
book, it will be a very memorable Era in my life. I am ignorant
whether my Borough will be Leskeard<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> or St. Germains. You

like me, but with more Philosophy, the news of his success.
Deyverdun is arrived to-day with his friend Lord M., who I
believe is <em>satisfied</em> with his travels. He is with me, and I have

<p>Since you have broke loose, my cold counsels must be changed
into warm wishes, and, as far as my nothingness can extend, into
warm actions. Yet my outset may appear careless and dilatory in
not writing to you or to the others on Saturday night. Your
damned coach kept the parcel all the evening, and it was not delivered
to me till yesterday morning, therefore it was impossible to
write sooner than to-day. It is very few borderers that Sir Hugh
can collect, but I am sure he will do his utmost. I had a proper
opportunity of writing to Lady Fetherstone, which I thought
was still better than to Lascelles. I have wrote to L. likewise.
I am sorry that you have started, but since you have done
the deed, I wish you had done it sooner. <em>Sir Thomas</em><a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> <em>has now</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>

away from them. After Wednesday I shall hourly expect some

<p>With regard to my silence, poor Clarke is too good and
too melancholy an excuse. I know not what to say about him;
he is reduced to nothing, and his disorder is attended with every
bad symptom. Yet his Physicians&mdash;Addington and Thomas&mdash;are
on the whole less desponding than they were some days ago.</p>

<p>Surely no affair was ever put into better hands than mine
has been. Your skill and friendship I am not surprized at, but
Mrs. Porten is a most excellent procuress, and The Lady Mother
has given as proper an answer as could be expected. There is
only one part of it which distresses me, <em>Religion</em>. It operates
doubly, as a present obstacle and a future inconvenience. Your
evasion was very able, but will not prudence as well as honour
require us being more explicit in the <em>suite</em>? Ought I to give
them room to think that I should patiently conform to family
prayers and Bishop Hooper's Sermons? I would not marry an
Empress on those conditions. I abhor a Devotee, though a
friend both to decency and toleration. However, my interests
are under your care, and if you think that no more need be said
on <em>the awkward</em> subject, I shall acquiesce.</p>

<p>After all, what occasion is there to enquire into my profession
of faith? It is surely much more to the purpose for them to
ask how I have already acted in life, whether as a good son, a
good friend, whether I game, drink, &amp;c. You know I never
practised the one, and in spite of my old <em>Dorsetshire</em> character, I
have left off the other. You once mentioned Miss F. I give
you my honour, that I have not either with her or any other
woman, any connection that could alarm a wife. With regard
to fortune Mrs. P. speaks in a very liberal manner; but above
all things, I think it should not be <em>magnified</em>. If it should be
necessary to hint at incumbrances, your delicacy I am sure
could place them in such a light as might raise the character of
the living without injuring the memory of the dead. You see
how serious I am in this business. If the general idea should
not startle Miss, the next consultation would be how, and where
the Lover may throw himself at her feet, contemplate her charms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>

<p>My poor friend died last Monday, and has left me&mdash;together
with Mr. Skipwith&mdash;his Executors and Trustees, a very
painful and perhaps thankless office. You will easily suppose
that the shock, however expected, and the hurry of melancholy

which he daily expects, still detains him in town. Give him a line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>

him. I say to him, rather than to me, because I lie Saturday night
at Twickenham and dine on Sunday with the Widow. The 17th
(Tuesday se'nnight) I shall be in Bentinck Street again, as our
Parliamentary Campaign opens on Thursday. Adieu. I write
with severall people in the room, and am called away to a Chess
party. Will <em>Maria excuse</em> my silence? but she should early be
taught that men retreat, when young Ladies advance.</p>

<p>I have had two very long days with Skipwith on poor Clarke's
affairs; they are indeed in a very distressed condition, and reckoning
the brother and sister's fortunes, £100,000 will hardly clear
them, but the means are large, my colleague indefatigable, and it
is the only office of friendship now left in my power. I could only
wish that our authority was less circumscribed.</p>

<p>On re-reading Sir Hugh's letter, which I had not yet done, I
find that after Winton's brother arrived they went to Petersfield,
consulted with another Lawyer, and when they had <em>shamefully and
scandalously</em> abused Andrews, paid the money and gave up everything,
Straw demand, &amp;c. They think no more of law, but will
pay their rent quarterly into my own hands only. Cannot I refuse
it (it will be disagreeable), and oblige them to pay it on the <em>spot to

</p>

<p>After the loss of my poor friend, I begin to be a little
relieved from the load of business and anxiety which his confidence
has devolved upon me in conjunction with Mr. Skipwith,
and with assistance the affairs of poor Clarke will soon be brought
into a regular method, which in time may enable us to discharge
our trust and to deliver a very noble Estate from a very heavy
incumbrance of debt. I now propose to spend the ten days that
remain before the meeting of Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> at Up-park. The
change of air will not I fancy do me any harm either in mind or
body; I mention the latter, as I find Sir Stanier betrayed me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
The Gout has now asserted his rights in an unquestionable
manner, but on this occasion he has exercised them in a very
gentle manner, and I can say with truth, that I find myself
rather benefitted than injured by his transient visit. I hope you
may be able to send me as good an account of the Rheumatism.</p>

<p>The Willow Garland you sent me has not much disconcerted
my Philosophy, and indeed the sanctity of the Lady, had a little
prepared me for, and reconciled me to, the disappointment. I
am only sorry that the ill-success of a negociation conducted
with so much ability and of so promising an appearance should
have given you a disgust for the honourable profession of
Ambassadress. On the contrary, I should hope that in the well-furnished
market we might, either now or hereafter, find the
opportunity of retrieving our first miscarriage.</p>

<p>Sir Stanier and Lady Porten exhibit a very pretty picture of
conjugal fondness and felicity, and yet they have been married
very near three weeks.</p>

<p>I have now, dear Madam, sent you the Christmas Draught,
and hope the short delay has not been attended with the least
inconveniency to you. It was occasioned by the obstinacy of
Winton, who obliged me to distress for rent. Hugonin obeyed
very spirited orders with skill and alacrity, and the well-timed
chastisement has rendered the Brute perfectly tame and submissive.
His character indeed is of much less consequence to me
than his substance, which is of a very responsible nature. Excuse
me for dwelling a moment on so trifling and disagreeable a
subject.</p>

<p>I received at Up-park your <em>long expected rescript</em>. Yesterday

uncertain are human affairs that accidents disapointed her. In
their room we had the fox-hunting friends of Sir Harry. Lord
Egremont, who is civil and sensible; General Pitt with his wife,
a determined Sportsman (I mean Sportswoman) who hunted all
the morning and slept all the evening. On my return I slept
with Hugonin. He was lamentable, as you may suppose, about
Winton's repairs, &amp;c. Yet I am satisfied Winton is cowed, and
my Repairs which were represented as a most dreadful account
leave Hug. in debt to me. They are all furious against Jolliffe,
and Lutterel endeavours to prove that the Lord of Buriton is the
real Lord of the Manor of Petersfield. I think I am obliged to
him. Will you have some matches? they may entertain My Lady

<p>*Sometimes people do not write because they are too idle, and
sometimes because they are too busy. The former was usually
my case, but at present it is the latter. The fate of Europe and
America seems fully sufficient to take up the time of one Man;
and especially of a Man who gives up a great deal of time for the
purpose of public and private information. I think I have sucked
Mauduit and Hutcheson very dry; and if my confidence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
equal to my eloquence, and my eloquence to my knowledge, perhaps
I might make no very intolerable Speaker. At all events,
I fancy I shall try to expose myself.</p>

<p class="center">
Semper ego auditor tantum? nunquamne reponam?<br />
</p>

<p>For my own part, I am more and more convinced that we have
both the right and the power on our side, and that, though the
effort may be accompanied with some melancholy circumstances,
we are now arrived at the decisive moment of persevering, or of
losing for ever both our Trade and Empire. We expect next
Thursday or Friday to be a very great day. Hitherto we have
been chiefly employed in reading papers, and rejecting petitions.
Petitions were brought from London, Bristol, Norwich, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
framed by party, and designed to delay. By the aid of some
parliamentary quirks, they have been all referred to a separate
inactive committee, which Burke calls a Committee of Oblivion,
and are now considered as dead in law. I could write you fifty
little House of Commons stories, but from their number and
nature they suit better a conference than a letter. Our general
divisions are about 250 to 80 or 90.*</p>

<p>Gilbert was with me this morning. He has been with the
Tythe Owner, whom Martin knows very well. The former seems
inclined to sell but by auction. I wish you would send for Gilbert
and settle something with him. I must soon write to Mrs. G.
What must I say? When do you fix the rent of Newhaven?
Remember Lady Day approaches: and we must say something
definitive to Martin. Caplin knows not any proper servant, but
will be so kind as to enquire, for his friend Mr. H. What
wages, &amp;c., do you give? Adieu. I embrace My Lady.</p>

<p>*An idle Man has no time, and a busy Man very little.
As yet the House of Commons turns out very well to me, and
though it should never prove of any real benefit to me, I find it at
least a very agreeable Coffee-house. We are plunging every day
deeper into the great business of America; and I have hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
been a zealous, though silent, friend to the Cause of Government,
which, <em>in this instance</em>, I think the Cause of England. I passed
about ten days, as I designed, at Up-park, but was a little disappointed
in my party. Instead of the Brothers I found Lord
Egremont and fourscore fox-hounds. Sir Henry is very civil and
good-humoured. But from the unavoidable temper of youth I
fear he will cost many a tear to Lady F. She consults everybody,
but has neither authority nor plan. In my return I called on the
Bayleys and lay at Nursted.</p>

<p>The Troubles of Buriton are perfectly composed, and the Insurgents
reduced to a state, though not a temper, of submission.
You may suppose I heard a great deal of Petersfield. Lutterel
means to convict your friend of Bribery, to transport him for
using a second time old stamps, and to prove that Petersfield is
still a part of the Manor of Buriton. I remain an impartial
Spectator.* I like the Epigram much. Don't you apprehend that
the Eliots [are] at Bath? Their Cornish friends talk of it. If
I should run down at Easter, would you secure me a Wife? It

you to take any measures that may be expedient for the general

just the mixture of business, of study, and of society, which I
always imagined I should, and now find I do, like. Whether
the House of Commons may ever prove of benefit to myself or
Country is another question. As yet I have been mute. In the

Sir Abraham Hume<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> has proposed to him to go abroad with his

especially as the first year or eighteen months were to be passed
in the uncomfortable University of Gottingen. But as he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
offered in a very handsome way a Life annuity of £100 per
annum which will secure him a Philosophic independence free
from the odious necessity of riding post with young cubs, reason
has compelled him to accept and me to acquiesce. He sets
out soon, though he still hopes to see you. A fortune that
would enable a Man to give him an Equivalent on less unpleasant
terms would just now be a very desirable thing.</p>

<p>Returned this moment from an American debate. A Remonstrance
and Representation from the Assembly of New York,
presented and feebly introduced by Burke, but most forcibly
supported by Fox.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> They disapprove of the violence of their

Parliament with regard to Commercial restraints and express
some affection and moderation; but they claim internal taxation,
state many grievances and formally object to the declaratory Act.
On the last ground it was impossible to receive it. Division

</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MARCH TO CONCORD.</div>

<p>You will probably see in the Papers, the Boston Gazette
Extraordinary. I shall therefore mention a few circumstances
which I have from Governor Hutchinson.</p>

<p>That Gazette is the only account arrived. As soon as the
business was over the Provincial Congress dispatched a vessel
with the news for the good people of England. The vessel was
taken up to sail instantly at a considerable loss and expence, as
she went without any lading but her ballast. No other letters
were allowed to be put on board, nor did the crew know their
destination till they were on the Banks of Newfoundland. The
Master is a man of character and moderation, and from his
mouth the following particulars have been drawn. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fides sit
penes auctorem.</i></p>

<p>It cannot fairly be called a defeat of the King's troops;
since they marched to Concord, destroyed or brought away the
stores, and then returned back.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> They were so much fatigued
with their day's work (they had marched above thirty miles)
that they encamped in the evening at some distance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Boston without being attacked in the night. It can hardly be
called an engagement, there never was any large body of Provincials.
Our troops during the march and retreat were chiefly
harrassed by flying parties from behind the stone walls along the
road and by many shots from the windows as they passed through
the villages. It was then they were guilty of setting fire to some
of those hostile houses. Ensign Gould had been sent with only
twelve men to repair a wooden bridge for the retreat; he was
attacked by the Saints with a minister at their head, who killed
two men and took the Ensign with the others prisoners. The
next day the Country rose. When the Master came away he
says that Boston was invested by a camp of about fifteen hundred
tents. They have canon. Their General is a Colonel Ward, a
member of the late Council, and who served with credit in the
last War. His outposts are advanced so near the town, that
they can talk to those of General Gage.</p>

<p>This looks serious, and is indeed so. But the Governor<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
observed to me that the month of May is the time for sowing
Indian corn, the great sustenance of the Province, and that unless
the Insurgents are determined to hasten a famine, they must have
returned to their own habitations: especially as the restraining
act (they had already heard of it) cuts off all foreign supply,
which indeed generally become necessary to the Province before
Winter. Adieu.</p>

<p>The American news becomes every hour more problematical.
Darby, the master of the Ship, has not condescended to show to
any one the original of the Salem Gazette. He has refused to
come to Lord Dartmouth, and what is still more extraordinary,
though he says he left his ship at Southampton, a person of
consequence sent down there by Government has not been able to
learn the least news about it. Yet on the other hand a ship from
New York is certainly arrived at Bristol with the report that a
Skirmish at Boston was talked of. No news from Gage. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
am I to do about Handkerchiefs? I thought the letter you sent
me for Downs was an order for them. He sent them to me
without my application, and they are already marked and used.
On the other hand Mrs. B[enjamin] W[ay] is outrageous. It is
all your fault and must be cleared up by you. I think I see
some hopes about Lovegrove, though too faint as yet to be worth
any detail. I rejoyce in My Lady's health. What is the name

I will fairly tell you the state of the case. If he does not visit

am just at present engaged in a great Historical Work, no less
than a History of the Decline and fall of the Roman Empire,
with the first Volume of which I may very possibly oppress the

particular idea of it: but I shall only say in general that the
subject is curious, and never yet treated as it deserves, and that

<p>I wish you would believe, what is really the case, that
before I received your letter I intended to have written this very
post. It is true that I had the same intention for many posts
before, and that the glorious spirit of procrastination always told
me that the next would do just as well: I do not mean as to

forgotten. *Deyverdun had left me just before your
letter arrived, which I shall soon have an opportunity of conveying
to him. Though, I flatter myself, he broke from me
with some degree of uneasiness, the engagement could not be
declined. At the end of the four years he has an annuity of
£100 for Life, and may, for the remainder of his days, enjoy a
decent independence in that Country, which a Philosopher would
perhaps prefer to the rest of Europe. For my own part, after
the hurry of the town and of Parliament, I am now retired to my
Villa in Bentinck Street, which I begin to find a very pleasing
Solitude, at least as well as if it were two hundred miles from
London; because when I am tired of the Roman Empire, I can
laugh away the Evening at Foote's Theatre, which I could not do
in Hampshire or Cornwall.* You know I am not a writer of news,
but I cannot forbear telling you that the Dutchess of Bedford
made regular proposals of marriage to the young Earl Cholmondely,

in the slightest degree, the secondary fever. Dr. Delacour assures
me that she is perfectly out of all danger: but hesitates about
acquainting her of my arrival these three or four days. He
knows not the value of time when the fate of an Empire depends
upon it. Without disclosing my motives, I urge business: and
at all events talk of setting out Thursday. Even if I should not
see her, the attention would be all the same. I ought to have
acquired some merit at the expence of infinite hurry, twenty
pounds (for I rattled with four horses and two servants for the
sake of sending Caplin forwards), and above all of a week's loss
of time. I am impatient on all accounts to get away; notwithstanding
the agreeable society of Mrs. Cochran, Misses Sharp, Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Matthews, and Bresboro the conjurer.&mdash;&mdash;After separating
them by a very long dash, I shall mention that I saw Breck
Street last night; Sally looks very poorly, and Mr. H. made me
melancholy by his desponding way of talking of himself. I have
likewise seen Foster, the father of Harry, who inquired much
after Jack Holroyd. Methinks he has something of the Brogue
upon the tip of his tongue now. How do you relish solitude?
Can you endure so many severe strokes which were inflicted in
one day? My adorations wait on My Lady, nor do I forget the
infant Spinny. Have you had any more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Desserts à la Francaise</i>?
Depend upon it you will always be properly opposed in such
arbitrary measures.</p>

<h3><em>To J. B. Holroyd, Esq.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Bentinck Street, October 14th, 1775.
</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I am safe enough in town, and so comfortably in
mine own dear Library, and mine own dear Parlour, that I
thought I might as well give myself a few Holydays from
any Epistolary cares. Aunt Hester starts Monday or Tuesday
<em>certainly</em>. It is <em>needless to say much of Bath</em>, from whence you
receive weekly folios. You have been <em>informed how artfully the
conspiracy was carried on</em>, and how I arrived eight and forty
hours after I came. Since my return (I will not tell you what
day) I have had regular and favourable despatches from Mrs.
Gould, and this day for the first time an Epistle from Mrs.
Gibbon herself, full of health, good spirits, and expressions of
gratitude. She is much concerned that I had the trouble of
coming to Bath, but if I know her, would have been much
<em>more concerned if I had</em> not come. So much for that business,
which has proved no inconsiderable interruption.</p>

<p>As to my domestic War, <em>Madox and the Solicitor-General</em> are
enlisted; they have each of them received a Guinea to drink my
health. Newton wanted likewise the Attorney-General; I hesitated,
and asked if it was necessary to employ three great Lawyers to
puzzle our plain case. A peremptory message was sent at the
same time to Matthews to demand his ultimate answer. He
replied by the next post that he would write as soon as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
seen Lovegrove, who was then from home. Unless they are at
once subdued by the terror of my arms, I much fear that our
dispute will last as long as the American Contest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIFFICULTY IN RAISING TROOPS.</div>

<p>Apropos of that Contest, *I send you two pieces of intelligence
from the best authority, and which, unless you hear them from some
other quarter, <em>I do not wish you should</em> talk much about. 1st,
When the Russians arrive,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> (if they refresh themselves in England
or Ireland,) will you go and see their Camp? We have great
hopes of getting a body of these Barbarians. In consequence
of some very plain advances, George, with his own hand, wrote
a very polite Epistle to sister Kitty, requesting her friendly
assistance. Full powers and instructions were sent at the same
time to Gunning, to agree for any force between five and twenty
thousand men, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carte blanche</i> for the terms; on condition,
however, that they should serve, not as Auxiliaries, but as
Mercenaries, and that the Russian General should be absolutely
under the command of the British. They daily and hourly
expect a Messenger, and hope to hear that the business is
concluded. The worst of it is, that the Baltic will soon be
froze up, and that it must be late next year before they can
get to America. 2nd. In the mean time we are not quite
easy about Canada;<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> and even if it should be safe from an
attack, we cannot flatter ourselves with the expectation of
bringing down that martial people on the back settlements. The
priests are ours; the Gentlemen very prudently wait the event,
and are disposed to join the stronger party; but the same
lawless spirit and impatience of Government which has infected
our Colonies, is gone forth among the Canadian Peasants, over
whom, since the Conquest, the Noblesse have lost much of
their ancient influence. Another thing which will please and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
surprize, is the assurance I received from a Man who might
tell me a lye, but who could not be mistaken, that no arts, no
management whatsoever have been used to procure the <em>Addresses
which fill</em> the Gazette,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> and that Lord N[orth] was as much
surprized at the first that came up, as we could be at Sheffield.
We shall have, I suppose, some brisk skirmishing in Parliament,
but the business will soon be decided by our superior weight of
fire. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A propos</i>, I believe there has been some vague but serious
conversation about <em>calling out the Militia</em>. The new Levies
go on very slowly in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> The Dissenters, both there and

and without being a prophet, I will venture to assure you,
that you are armed against it for the remainder of your life. I

<p>I am still alive, and in spite of the influenza perfectly
well. But why have you not at least written <em>one</em> line in so very
long a space of time? All that I can say on the subject is to
declare with the utmost sincerity that not a single morning has
arisen without my forming the resolution to write before the
evening, and that not a single evening post-bell has rang without
sounding the alarm to my conscience. In the mean time, days,
hours and weeks have imperceptibly rolled away: a perpetual
hurry and long days of Parliamentary business, the whole world
coming to town at once, and a great deal of occupation at home
relative to my History, which will come out some time after
Christmas. In a word, I do not like to write to you, but I
want very much to see you. Have you totally forgot your
promise of making me a visit in town? I can lodge you, &amp;c.,
without the smallest inconveniency, and I am sure that after
getting the better of so formidable an enemy as you have done,
nothing would be so likely to give the last polish as a change
of air, of situation and of company. Be so kind as to send me

</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS BOOK ALMOST READY.</div>

<p>Had I not been engaged in hastening and finishing the
Impression, I would with great pleasure have made you a Christmas
visit. I may truly say to you and not to Bath, for I have never
much relished the style and amusements of that seat of idleness
which so many people are fond of; and I am much inclined to
think that if you fixed your residence in any other part of the
Kingdom, I might pass the remainder of my life without ever
seeing Bath again. Since I have mentioned my book, let me add
that it will probably make its appearance about the middle or
end of February: and that one of the very first copies of it shall
be carefully transmitted to Charles Street. The Public, I know
not why, except from the happy choice of the subject, have already
conceived expectations, which it will not be easy to satisfy: the
more especially as lively ignorance is apt to expect much more
than the nature and extent of historical materials can enable an
author to produce. However, if the first volume is decently
received in the world, I shall be encouraged to proceed; and
shall find before me a stock of labour and of amusement sufficient
to engage my attention for many years. The prosecution of
some scheme is in my opinion the circumstance the most conducive
to the happiness of life, and, of all schemes, the best is surely
that, the success of which chiefly depends on ourselves. Parliamentary
business, and agreeable society fill the eye, the intervals
of my time, and my situation would in every respect be a comfortable
one, if I could only put an end to my Buckinghamshire
sale, which is still attended with many difficulties, and will
hardly be decided without the interposition of Chancery. You
will not wonder that I lose time and catch at every hope, rather
than involve myself in that labyrinth of Chicane and expense.</p>

<p>I say nothing of public affairs. Never did they wear a more
melancholy aspect. We much fear that Quebec<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> will not hold out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the Winter. The Provincials have everywhere displayed courage
and abilities worthy of a better cause; and those of my Ministerial
friends who are the best acquainted with the state of America,
are the least sanguine in their hopes of success for next year.</p>

<p>An odd discovery is just now made. At a sale in the country,
an old cabinet was going to be knocked down for twenty shillings,
when the curiosity of some people present urged them to examine
it more closely. Two private drawers were found; one of which
contained bank-notes to a very large amount, the other held an
older and more valuable curiosity; the individual ring of Queen
Elizabeth, the Earl of Essex, Lady Nottingham, &amp;c.: you
remember the story.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> It was in a very fine purse embroidered
with pearls; and is authenticated by a writing, found in the
same purse, of an old Lady Cook who attended the Queen in her
visit to the Countess, and picked up the ring when her Majesty
threw it from her with horror and indignation. I have seen the
purse and ring (a yellow kind of diamond) at Barlow's, a silk-mercer
in King Street, Covent Garden, who affirms that he has
read the paper, but the mystery which is made about the place of
sale, and the name of the present proprietor, leaves room for
suspicion. Horace Walpole is determined, if possible, to get to
the bottom of the affair.</p>

<p>I hope, dear Madam, that not only your health, but your beauty
likewise, are perfectly restored, but I must desire an explicit and
<em>satisfactory</em> answer about your promised visit to London. The
air will, I am sure, be of the greatest service to you, and as the
Spring will soon advance upon us, you may easily connect London
with Essex, Sussex or any other part of the Kingdom, where you
have any visits to make or promises to fulfill.</p>

of my own situation, and to rejoice in my own prudence, in not
going down to S. P., as I seriously but foolishly intended to do
last week.* Hugonin by appointment came to town, but we soon
agreed that the expedition (on his side at least) must be deferred
till next summer; for which time he made a very solemn and, as
I believe, a very serious engagement. We talked over Horn
farm, which will be let next month by auction, and I am only
afraid of getting too much money for it. Chalk woods, &amp;c.,
settled to admiration, and every thing goes well except the
d&mdash;&mdash;d Lovegrove. However I have had the arrears of rent
paid into Fleet street: which leaves a very moderate balance of
interest against me.</p>

month. I have nothing public. You know we have got 18,000
Germans from Hesse Brunswick and Hesse Darmstadt. I think
our meeting will be lively; a spirited Minority, and a desponding
Majority. The higher people are placed, the more gloomy are
their countenances, the more melancholy their language. You
may call this cowardice, but I fear it arises from <em>their knowledge</em>
(a late knowledge) of the difficulty and magnitude of the business.
Quebec is not <em>yet</em> taken. I hear that Carleton is determined
never to capitulate with Rebels. A glorious resolution if it were

From post to post I have expected a letter to fix the time and

(though a very sedentary animal myself) whether I cannot visit

most convenient leisure that I am likely to enjoy in the whole

days. The Eliots, who with great difficulty have existed in town
about two months, seem to intend moving towards that place
about the same time. The Holroyds are likewise in town: they
have inoculated their girl, and I understand with the greatest
pleasure that there are some hopes of an increase of family.&mdash;As
to myself, I have the satisfaction of telling you that my
book has been very well received by men of letters, men of

</p>

<p>*I am angry, that you should impede my noble designs of
visiting foreign parts, more especially as I have an advantage
which Sir Wilful had not, that of understanding your foreign
lingos. With regard to Mrs. Gibbon, her intended visit, to
which I was not totally a stranger, will do me honour, and
though it should delay my emigration till the end of July, there
will still remain the months of August, September and October.
Above all abstain from giving the least hint to any Bath Correspondent,
and perhaps, if I am not provoked by opposition, the
thing may not be absolutely certain. At all events you may depend
on a previous visit. At present I am very busy with the Neckers.
I live with her just as I used to do twenty years ago, laugh at
her Paris varnish, and oblige her to become a simple reasonable
Suissesse. The man, who might read English husbands lessons
of proper and dutiful behaviour, is a sensible good-natured
creature. In about a fortnight I again launch into the World in
the shape of a quarto Volume. The dear Cadell assures me that
he never remembered so eager and impatient a demand for a
second Edition.</p>

<p>The town is beginning to break up; the day after to-morrow
we have our last day in the house of Commons to inquire into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>

<p>Shame, shame, always shame&mdash;&mdash;Yet two lines will I
write in the midst of a crowd. My mornings have been very
much taken up with preparing and correcting (though in a minute
and almost imperceptible way) my new Edition, which will be out
the 1st of June. My afternoons (barring the House of Commons)
have been a good deal devoted to Madame Necker. Her husband
and the rest of her servants leave this country next Tuesday,
entertained with the Island, and owning that the barbarous
people have been very kind to them. Do you know that they
have almost extorted a promise to make them a short visit at
Paris in the Autumn. But pray, Madam, when do you set out,
the month of June draws near, and both myself, the Portens and
the inhabitants of Sheffield Place are impatient to be informed

probably more than he does for himself at present. His "William

June the 6th, 1776, from Almack's, where I was chose last week.
</p>

<p>*To tell you any thing of the change or rather changes of
Governors I must have known something of them myself: but
all is darkness confusion and uncertainty; to such a degree
that people do not even know what lyes to invent. The news
from America have indeed diverted the public attention into
another and far greater channel. All that you see in the papers
of the repulse at Quebec as well as the capture of Lee<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> rests on
the authority (a very unexceptionable one) of the Provincial
papers as they have been transmitted by Governor Tryon from
New York. Howe is well and eats plentifully, and the weather
seems to clear up so fast that according to the English custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
we have passed from the lowest despondency, to a full assurance
of success.</p>

<p>My new birth happened last Monday, 700 of the 1500 were
gone yesterday. I now understand from pretty good authority
that Dr. Porteous,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> the friend and chaplain of St. Secker, is
actually sharpening his goose quill against the last two Chapters.*
Mrs. G. has not yet signified her intentions about the London
and Sheffield expedition. I have not advanced one single step
with regard to Lovegrove. Palmer will not interfere till he has
seen the abstract of the title with Duane's observations, which
we cannot get them to communicate even to their own friend.

<div class="sidenote">SECOND EDITION OF HIS BOOK.</div>

<p>*Yes, yes I am alive and well; but what shall I say? Town
grows empty and this house, where I have passed very agreable
hours, is the only place which still unites the flower of the English
youth. The style of living though <em>somewhat</em> expensive is exceedingly
pleasant and notwithstanding the rage of play I have found
more entertaining and even rational society here than in any other
Club to which I belong. Mrs. G. still hangs in suspense and
seems to consider a town expedition with horror. I think however
that she will be soon in motion, and when I have her in
Bentinck-street we shall perhaps talk of a Sheffield excursion. I
am now deeply engaged in the reign of Constantine, and from
the specimens which I have already seen, I can venture to
promise that the second Volume will not be less interesting than
the first. The 1500 Copies are moving off with decent speed, and
the obliging Cadell begins to mutter something of a third Edition
for next year. No news of Deyverdun or his French translation.
What a lazy dog! Madame Necker has been gone a great while.
I gave her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en partant</i> the most solemn assurances of following her

to whisper a thousand difficulties and, unless your absurd policy
should thoroughly provoke me, the Parisian journey may possibly
be deferred. I rejoyce in the progress of * * * towards light.

extravagance, his circumstances were embarrassed, and he had

<p>At a large Meeting of the most considerable Wits of the
two Islands, it was agreed that Rouen Ducks have white feathers,
but this is not the whole business of this letter. The Gibbon
has so often declared an intention of letting Mrs. Gibbon know
that he is well without so doing, that it is just determined to
acquaint her he exists. Moreover Mrs. H. and the Brat are
quite well, and Mrs. H. wishes for an opportunity of promoting
eloquence in Mrs. Gibbon on Gothic Architecture.</p>

<p>It is a certain fact that the Gibbon exists, and that his
resolutions have been as usual much better than his intentions.
He looks back with pleasure and regret on the time with Mrs.
Gibbon, and most sincerely hopes that as she has now conquered
all the Lyons upon the road, she will no longer entertain any
apprehensions of the Journey. Mrs. Porten is well, and I believe
has written. The other day I told her that there was an Irish
edition of the Decline. Her question amused me. "Do you
understand it?" She supposed it was published in the Irish
language. The natives have printed it very well, and the notes
at the bottom take up much less space than I could have imagined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEARS OF WAR WITH FRANCE.</div>

<p>I hardly dare recollect how long I have been without
writing to you, but you know my sentiment and my laziness;
so I will say no more on that threadbare subject. I have been
some days at this place and have spent them very agreeably.
Luckily the weather has been bad, which in a great measure
has secured me from excursions, and confined us to an excellent
house, conducted on an easy plan, and filled with a comfortable
society in which the principal part was performed by Mr. Garrick.
I return to town to-morrow. By-the-bye, you will be so good
as not to mention this Bedfordshire journey to Miss Holroyd:
it might get round to Sheffield Place which I have cheated of
a promised visit. In a few days our Parliamentary campaign
will open, and the beginning of success which we have tasted in
America will enliven our countenances, if they should not be
clouded again by the apprehensions of a French war, which seem
to increase every day. With regard to another great object
of hostilities,&mdash;<em>myself</em>,&mdash;the attack has been already begun by an
anonymous Pamphleteer, but the heavy artillery of Dr. Watson
and another adversary are not yet brought into the field. I was
afraid that I should be hurt by them, but if I may presume of
my future feelings from the first tryal of them, I shall be in every
sense of the word <em>invulnerable</em>.</p>

<p>My long depending and troublesome business with Lovegrove
is at length, by the strenuous interposition of Holroyd, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
concluded, but broke off. The fellow wanted either power or
inclination to compleat his agreement, and after weighing all
the difficulties and delays of Chancery, it was judged most
expedient to consent to a mutual discharge. By this transaction
I have lost a great deal both of time and money, and am now
to begin the sale again. It has occasioned me much vexation,
but Holroyd assures me that I have been guilty of no fault,
and that I may still entertain very fair hopes. The subject
was grown so odious to me, that I could not bring myself even
to talk to you about it. Adieu, Dear Madam. Remember that
by your summer excursions you gain health and give pleasure.

<div class="sidenote">FRENCH TRANSLATION OF HIS HISTORY.</div>

<p>Quand on se propose de visiter un pays étranger où la
langue que nous parlons n'est pas connue, on doit chercher les
plus habiles interprètes de ses pensées. C'est pour cette raison
que vous me permettrez de m'adresser à vous au sujet de mon
histoire de la décadence et de la chute de l'Empire Romain.</p>

<p>Quand j'ai en le plaisir ce printems dernier de vous voir à
Londres avec M. et Madame Necker, je crois vous avoir dit que
mon ami Deyverdun s'étoit chargé de ma traduction, et qu'il
se proposoit de la faire paroître en Allemagne, où il séjourne
actuellement avec ce jeune Anglois. Mais l'exactitude et la
diligence ne sont pas du nombre des vertus de mon ami;
et après un long silence qui n'a pas laissé de m'ettonner, je
reçus hier au soir une lettre de sa part, par laquelle j'apprens
que sa paresse, ses occupations et les projets de son élève l'obligent
de renoncer absolument à cette entreprise qu'il avoit à peine
commencée. Me voici donc à present libre mais isolé. J'ai
toujours méprisé la triste philosophie qui veut nous rendre
insensibles à la gloire. J'ambitionne celle d'être lu en France
et dans le Continent; et je me verrois au comble de mes désirs,
si la même plume qui a si bien rendu l'éloquence historique de
Robertson vouloit se preter à un écrivain son inferieur à tous
egards mais qui a reçu de l'indulgence de ses compatriotes un
acceuil presqu'aussi favorable. Un succès si flatteur m'encourage
à me livrer avec ardeur à la composition du second volume.
Malgré la dissipation de Londres et les soins du Parlement
j'y ai déjà fait quelque progrès et je compte avec une assurance
assez bien fondée de pouvoir l'achever dans deux ou tout au plus
dans trois ans. Comme je m'empresserois alors de vous envoyer
les feuilles à mesure qu'elles sortiroient de la presse, il nous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
seroit facile de nous arranger de manière que ce volume parût
en même tems dans les deux langues.</p>

<p>Si vous avez, Monsieur, l'inclination et le loisir de vous engager
dans ce travail, je ne perçeois plus que deux obstacles, qui sont
à la verité assez considerables. Le premier c'est l'objet et la
nature de mes deux derniers chapitres, qui doivent paroitre
moins edifians encore en France qu'en Angleterre. Je sens
cependant qu'un homme d'esprit rompu comme vous dans l'art
d'écrire seroit souvent en état d'adoucir l'expression sans
affoiblir la pensée. Je ne craindrois pas de vous confier les
droits les plus étendus pour changer et même pour supprimer
tout ce qui vous paroitroit le plus propre à blesser la delicatesse
de votre église et de votre police. J'irais moi-même au devant
de leurs scrupules et si par le moyen des couriers de nos ministres,
vous m'envoyez les feuilles de la traduction, je vous aiderois à
enlever toutes les pierres d'achoppement. Enfin si malgré toutes
ces précautions l'ouvrage se trouvoit encore trop fort pour
passer à la censure, ne pourroit on pas obtenir par le crédit de
nos amis communs un privilège tacite qui suffiroit pour mettre
votre edition à couvert de l'avidité des libraires? L'autre obstacle
se tire de la crainte que dans cet intervalle de tems perdu par la
negligence de mon ami, Deyverdun, quelque main assurément
moins habile ne vous ait déjà prevenu. On m'a parlé fort
confusement d'une traduction entreprise par Moutard, libraire
sur le quai des Augustins, mais j'ignore jusqu'a quel point elle
est avancée et quelles mesures on prend pour le faire paroitre.
Vous êtes à portée, Monsieur, de vous informer et je conçois que
cet eclaircissement pourra influer sur vos resolutions, et j'ose
vous prier de me les communiquer au plûtot.</p>

<p>Mes affaires ne m'ont pas permis de faire un voyage à Paris
cet été. J'ai senti douleureusement cette privation dont je ne
me suis consolé qu'en formant des projets pour l'année prochaine.
Quand on se rappelle les momens delicieux qu'on a passés avec
Madame Necker dans ce taudis de Suffolk Street, toutes nos
Angloises paroissent encore plus froides et plus maussades. Ayez

<p>You will receive this post a large parcel which came last night
from Northamptonshire and to which you must return an immediate
answer, as the old Lady seems impatient. Her wanting me
to lend her money in contradiction to all rules established between
Aunts and Nephews is a very <em>ugly</em> circumstance. I do not like
to borrow money to purchase land; nor to lend money without
being able to call for either principal or interest. Yet she might
in various ways be offended at my declining it. Therefore if the
Tythes can be dispensed with, give an opinion against them. I
do not like Gilbert; he says that Martin has a long lease of land
two miles from Newhaven, and that he could distress us by taking
in kind. Consider, and if there is doubt enquire.</p>

et pour vous témoigner les sentimens auxquels vous avez acquis les

Paris et exposé au danger de déshonorer par des liaisons honteuses
le nom qu'il portoit. S'il apprenoit donc, d'un coup, qu'une
main secourable retirant son fils d'un état aussi triste l'avoit présenté
dans les meilleures compagnies de Paris avec un éclat et des
avantages qu'il ne tenoit point de sa naissance, jugez, Monsieur,
des sensibilités de ce Père envers son ami et son bienfaiteur.
L'estime seroit augmentée par la reconnoissance et leur affection
commune pour l'objet de leurs soins deviendroit peut-être le lien
le plus étroit de leur amitié. Pour parler sans figure de votre
traduction de l'histoire de la décadence de l'Empire Romain, je
l'ai lu, Monsieur, avec autant de plaisir que d'aviditê. Je crains
de trop louer une production à laquelle j'ai moi-même fourni les
materiaux, mais cette crainte ne doit pas m'interdire d'accorder
des justes éloges qui sont dus à votre parfaite intelligence de
l'original Anglois, et à la fidelité, aussi bien qu'à l'elegance, avec
laquelle vous l'avez transporté dans votre langue. Si dans un
petit nombre d'endroits j'ai été moins content de la traduction,
ce ne sont que de legères meprises presqu'inevitables dans un
ouvrage de longue haleine et auxquelles l'obscurité du texte peut
quelquefois avoir donné lieu. Je prendrai la liberté de vous
envoyer à la première occasion les observations qui se sont
presentées à mesure que je lisois votre ouvrage; vous en ferez
l'usage que vous jugerez le convenable. J'attens avec une vive
impatience la suite de la traduction, et si le succès de la première
partie ne vous encourage pas à la continuer, je déclare d'avance
que ce ne sera point votre faute mais celle de l'original. Au cas que
vous ne renonciez pas à cette enterprise, je serois charmé que
vous voulussiez bien m'envoyer les épreuves, au sortir de la presse,
je les examinerai avec toute l'attention de l'amour propre, et
comme vous avez déjà gagné de vitesse sur vos concurrens, le
délai de quelques jours seroit d'une assez petite importance. A
propos, Monsieur, quel parti prendrez vous à l'égard des deux
derniers chapitres? En Angleterre même ils ont excité, je ne
sais pourquoi, du scandale parmi nos Ecclesiastiques, et malgré
toutes vos précautions j'ai de la peine à concevoir comment ils
pourrent soutenir la censure sévère de votre Eglise et de votre
police. Mais nous avons du tems pour y songer; car je pense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
que dans tous ces chapitres, qui forment votre 2<sup>e</sup> partie, il n'y a

<p>Je regrette sincèrement de n'avoir pas eu le plaisir de vous

<p>*As I presume, My Lady does not make a practise of tumbling
down stairs every day after dinner, by this time the colours must
have faded, and the high places (I mean the temples) are reduced
to a proper level. But what, in the name of the great prince, is
the meaning of her declining the urban expedition? Is it the

from the secret machinations of her domestic tyrant? At all

Mountaineer, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Things go on very prosperously in America. Howe is himself
in the Jerseys, and will push at least as far as the Delawar
River. The Continental (perhaps <em>now</em> the rebel) Army is in
a great measure dispersed, and Washington, who wishes to
cover Philadelphia, has not more than 6 or 7 thousand men
with him. Clinton designs to conquer Rhode Island in his
way home. But what <em>I</em> think of much greater consequence, a
province has made its submission, and desired to be reinstated in
the peace of the King. It is indeed only poor little Georgia, and
the application was made to Governor Tonyn of Florida; some
disgust at a violent step of the Congress, who removed the
President of <em>their</em> provincial assembly, a leading and popular
man, co-operated with the fear of the Indians, who began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
amuse themselves with the exercise of scalping on their back

<p>Instead of inventing any artificial excuses for my natural
and original sin of indolence, I believe my most prudent method
would be to quarrel with you for the provoking patience with
which you have endured my long and scandalous silence. Even
in the midst of the dissipation of this town I might have found
a few moments to tell you that I have been perfectly well this
winter, and to enquire after your health, your spirits and your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
amusements. Lady Dy. tells me that she was once in your company
at Dr. Delacour's, for whom both she and Beauclerc express
a veneration almost equal to your own. As little or no conversation
passed between you, she had only an opportunity of admiring
the harmony of your voice and the beauty of your teeth, on which
she bestows the most lavish enconiums. They mean to visit Bath
again this spring, and I am very desirous that you should be
better acquainted with her. You will find her one of the most
accomplished women in the World, and she will soon discover in
you qualities more valuable than those which are now the objects
of her enconiums.</p>

<p>The decline of the Roman Empire does not yet decline, the
clamour subsides, the sale continues, and we are now printing
a third edition in quarto of 1000 copies (in all 3500) with
the notes at bottom. I am often pressed about the second
volume, which advances very slowly indeed. Last year was
allowed for repose and preparation, the usual distractions of the
winter have been increased by a constant daily attendance of two
hours <em>every day</em> to Dr. Hunter's Anatomy Lectures, which have
opened to me a new and very entertaining scene within myself.
This summer I propose passing at Paris, as I must not lose any
time if I wish to catch my friends the Neckers<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> in their brilliant
and precarious situation of Ministers. As soon as we have paid
the King's debts I intend (about the end of next month) to set
forward on an expedition in which I promise to myself very great
and various entertainment. You need not in any respect be
allarmed at my design. My seat at Westminster is a full security
for my return in four or five months; the supplies for the journey
will be paid by the Roman Empire, and my business (particularly

<p>I will freely acknowledge that I was not a little surprized
and even vexed at finding by your last letter, that you had
conceived so strong a dislike to my intended journey. But I
must add at the same time that I was equally sensible of the
obliging frankness with which you communicate your objections.
The less foundation I can discover for your apprehensions, the
more I am convinced of the delicacy of your regard. True love
is of very timid and even pusillanimous nature, and can easily
transform the most harmless objects into horrid phantoms which
appear to threaten the happiness of those who are dear to us.
But when you have indulged the exquisite sensibility of friendship,
you will, I am sure, make a proper use of your excellent understanding,
and will soon smile at your own terrors. The constancy
and danger of a twenty years' passion is a subject upon which
I hardly know how to be serious. I am ignorant what effect
that period of time has produced upon me, but I do assure you
that it has committed very great ravages upon the Lady, and
that at present she is very far from being an object either of
desire or scandal. As a woman of talents and fortune she is
at the head of the literature of Paris, the station of her husband
procures her respect from the first people of the country, and
the reception which I shall meet with in her house will give
me advantages that have fallen to the share of few Englishmen.
When I mention her <em>house</em>, I must remove the misapprehension
which seems to have allarmed you. I shall <em>visit</em> but not <em>lodge</em>
there. I have not the least reason to believe that they think
of offering me an apartment, but if they do, I shall certainly
refuse it, for the sake of my own comfort and freedom: So that
the husband will be easy, the world will be mute, and my moral
character will still preserve its immaculate purity.</p>

<p>A moment's reflection will satisfy you that I have as little to
fear from the hatred of the priests as from the love of Madame N.
Whatever might be the wishes of the French Clergy, the wisdom of
the Government and the liberal temper of the Nation have rendered
those monsters perfectly inoffensive. Their own subjects (Voltaire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
for instance, who resides near Geneva, but in France) think,
converse and write with the most unbounded freedom: and can
you imagine that an English Protestant, a member of the British
Legislature, living at Paris under the protection of his Minister,
and in Society with their own, will be exposed to the smallest
possible danger or even trouble for having published a profane
book in a foreign language and country? When David Hume
(the name, the most abhorred by the Godly) was at Paris, he
was oppressed only with civilities; and the recent fame of my
book is perhaps the circumstance which will introduce me with
the most favour and eclat.</p>

<p>The scheme of passing some months at Paris (though I
have patiently waited till I could execute it with prudence and
propriety) has been formed many years ago. I cannot persuade
myself without any reason that strikes my understanding to
renounce an expedition which promises so much entertainment
and information: but it will be a very considerable alloy to my
satisfaction if I leave any uneasiness or apprehension on your
mind. I could very much have wished to fulfil my promise of an
Easter visit; but I imagined that I had already explained how
closely I was confined in town by my daily attendance on Dr.
Hunter's lectures. They prevent my setting out for Paris till
after the 25th instant, by which time I hope we shall have paid
the King's debts.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> You may depend on receiving regular though
concise intelligence of my motions.</p>

<p class="head">
Paris, June the 16th, 1777.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS SUCCESS IN FRENCH SOCIETY.</div>

<p>I told you what would infallibly happen, and you know enough
of the nature of the beast not to be surprized at it. I have now
been at Paris exactly five weeks,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> during which time I have not
written to any person whatsoever within the British Dominions
except two lines of notification to Mrs. Gibbon. The Daemon
of procrastination has at length yielded to the Genius of Friendship,
assisted indeed by the powers of fear and shame. But when
I have seated myself before my table and begin to revolve all
that I have seen and tasted during this busy period, I feel myself
oppressed and confounded; and I am very near throwing away
the pen and resigning myself to indolent despair. A compleat
history would require a volume at least as corpulent as the decline
and fall, and if I attempt to select and abridge, besides the
difficulty of the choice there occur so many things which cannot
properly be entrusted to paper, and so many others of too slight
a nature to support the Journey, that I am almost tempted to
reserve for our future conversations the detail of my pleasures and
occupations. But as I am sensible that you are <em>rigid</em> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
impatient, I will try to convey in a few words a general idea of
my situation as a man of the World and as a man of Letters.</p>

<p>You remember that the Neckers were my principal dependance,
and the reception which I have met with from them very far
surpassed my most sanguine expectations. I do not indeed lodge
in their house (as it might excite the jealousy of the husband and
procure me a letter de cachet), but I live very much with them,
dine and sup whenever they have company, which is almost
every day, and whenever I like it, for they are not in the least
exigeans. Mr. Walpole gave me an introduction to Madame du
Deffand,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> an agreable young Lady of eighty-two years of age, who
has constant suppers and the best company in Paris. When you
see the D. of Richmond at Lewes he will give you an account of
that house, where I meet him almost every evening. Ask him
about Madame de Cambis.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> I am afraid poor Mary is entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
forgot. I have met the D. of Choiseul<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> at his particular request,
dined <em>by accident</em> with Franklin, conversed with the Emperor,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
been presented at court, and gradually, or rather rapidly, I find
my acquaintance spreading over the most valuable parts of Paris.
They pretend to like me, and whatever you may think of French
professions, I am convinced that some at least are sincere. On
the other hand I feel myself easy and happy in their company, and
only regret that I did not come over two or three months sooner.
Though Paris throughout the summer promises me a very
agreable society, yet I am hurt every day by the departure of
Men and Women whom I begin to know with some familiarity,
the departure of Officers for their Governments and Garrisons, of
Bishops for their Dioceses, and even of country Gentlemen for
their estates, as a rural taste gains ground in this Country.</p>

<p>So much for the general idea of my acquaintance; details would
be endless yet unsatisfactory. You may add to the pleasures of
Society those of the Spectacles and promenades, and you will find
that I lead a very agreable life; let me just condescend to
observe that it is not extravagant. After decking myself out
with silks and silver, the ordinary establishment of Coach,
Lodgeing, Servants, eating and pocket expences does not exceed
sixty pounds pr. month. Yet I have two footmen in handsome
liveries behind my Coach, and my apartment is hung with damask.
Adieu for the present. I have more to say, but were I to attempt
any farther progress you must wait another post, and you have
already waited long enough of all conscience.</p>

<p>Let me just in two words give you an idea of my day. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
now going (nine o'clock) to the King's Library, where I shall stay
till twelve. As soon as I am dressed I set out to dine with the
Duke de Nivernois,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> shall go from thence to the French Comedy
into the Princess de Beauvau's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">loge grillée</i>,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> and am not quite
determined whether I shall sup at Madame du Deffand's, Madame
Necker's, or the Sardinian Embassadress's.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Once more Adieu.
Do not be fond of shewing my letter; the playful effusions of
friendship would be construed by strangers as gross vanity.</p>

<p>I embrace My lady and Bambine. I shall with chearfulness
execute any of her commissions.</p>

Hotel de Modene, Paris, July 24th, 1777.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES.</div>

<p>If ever my negligence could be excused by your good
natured friendship, it would be from the consideration of my
present circumstances, and I am sure that your regard for me is
of so pure and disinterested a character that you had much rather
I should be happy without hearing from me, than if you received
by every post a regular succession of complaints. Happily
indeed have I passed two short months since my arrival at Paris,
and every circumstance of my journey has more than answered
my most sanguine expectations. My connection with the Neckers,
who every day acquire more power and deserve more respect, first
opened the door to me, and perhaps the reputation of a popular
writer has contributed a little to enlarge the entrance. I pass my
time in the society of men of letters, people of fashion, the higher
ranks of <em>the clergy</em>, and the foreign Ministers, and except when I
wish to steal a few moments' privacy, it seldom happens to me
to dine or sup at my hotel. The vacancies of my time are filled
by the public libraries in the morning, and in the afternoon by
the spectacles, and as part of my acquaintance begin to disperse
themselves in the environs of Paris, I have contrived, though in a
most unfavourable season, to make several very pleasant excursions.
Such is the general idea of my life, in which I have made many
acquaintance and formed some more intimate connections, from
all of which I receive civilities, amusement and information.
Details would be infinite, and must be reserved for your fireside
at Bath; but I cannot forbear saying something of two or three
persons whom you know.</p>

<p>First then you will expect to hear of Mrs. Mallet. Mr.
Scott had desired me to take charge of a letter, and I delivered
it to her own fair hands the second day after my arrival. She
received me with a shriek of joy and a close embrace, and we
sat down to talk of old and new subjects. I found her exactly
the same talkative, positive, passionate, conceited creature as
we knew her twenty years ago. She raved with her usual
indiscretion and fury of Gods, Kings and Ministers, the perfections
of her favourites and the vice or folly of every person she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
disliked. Unfortunately she had applied to Mr. Necker for some
favour, and had not been received in a manner suitable to her
importance. Her resentment was expressed in such indecent
language, that after repeated but ineffectual hints of my intimate
connection with the person she was abusing, I was obliged to
shorten my visit with a firm resolution of never returning.</p>

<p>Your favourite, the Duke of Richmond, has fallen in my way
infinitely more than he ever did in England, and I do assure you
that the air of Paris agrees perfectly well with him. He is easy,
attentive and cheerful, pays his court to young and to old women,
and is extremely popular and even fashionable in the Society of
Paris. I have likewise seen a great deal of the Sardinian Ambassadress
whom you have formerly known with Lady Cobham,
under the name of Miss Speed. She keeps a very hospitable house,
and has acquired the manners of the country without losing the
sentiments of her own. Adieu, Dear Madam. If you can think
of any commissions for me I will execute them with care and
pleasure, though I have no occasion for any memento to make
me often think of you.</p>

<p>Sir Stanier will be so good as to forward anything to me.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h3><em>To J. B. Holroyd, Esq.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Paris, August the 11th, 1777.
</p>

<p>*Well, and who is the Culprit now?&mdash;Thus far I had written
in the pride of my heart, and fully determined to inflict an
Epistle upon you, even before I received any answer to my
former; I was very near a Bull. But this forward half line lay
ten days barren and inactive, till its generative powers were
excited by the missive which I received yesterday.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NO IMMEDIATE RISK OF FRENCH WAR.</div>

<p>What a wretched piece of work do we seem to be making of
it in America! The greatest force which any European power
ever ventured to transport into that Continent, is not strong
enough even to attack the enemy; the Naval strength of Great
Britain is not sufficient to prevent the Americans (they have
almost lost the appellation of Rebels) from receiving every
assistance that they wanted; and in the mean time you are
obliged to call out the Militia to defend your own coasts against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
their privateers.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> You possibly may expect from me some account
of the designs and policy of the French Court, but I chuse to
decline that task for two reasons: 1<sup>st,</sup> Because you may find them
laid open in every newspaper; and 2<sup>ndly,</sup> Because I live too much
with their Courtiers and Ministers to know anything about them.
I shall only say that I am not under any immediate apprehensions
of a War with France. It is much more pleasant as well as
profitable to view in safety the raging of the tempest, occasionally
to pick up some pieces of the Wreck, and to improve their trade,
their agriculture, and their finances, while the two countries are
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lento collisa duello</i>. Far from taking any step to put a speedy
end to this astonishing dispute, I should not be surprized if next
summer they were to lend their cordial assistance to England, as
to the weaker party. As to my personal engagement with the
D[uke] of R[ichmond], I recollect a very few slight skirmishes,
but nothing that deserves the name of a general engagement.
The extravagance of some disputants, both French and English,
who have espoused the cause of America, sometimes inspires me
with an extraordinary vigour. Upon the whole, I find it much
easier to defend the justice than the policy of our Measures; but
there are certain cases, where whatever is repugnant to sound
policy ceases to be just.</p>

<p>The more I see of Paris, the more I like it.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
course of the Society in which I live is easy, polite, and entertaining;
and almost every day is marked by the acquisition of some
new acquaintance, who is worth cultivating, or who, at least, is
worth remembering. To the great admiration of the French, I
regularly dine and regularly sup, drink a dish of strong Coffee
after each meal, and find my stomach a citizen of the World.
The Spectacles, (particularly the Italian, and above all the French
Comedie) which are open the whole summer, afford me an agreeable
relaxation from Company; and to shew you that I frequent
them from taste only, and not from idleness, I have not yet seen
the Colisee, the Vauxhall, the Boulevards, or any of those places
of entertainment which constitute Paris to most of our Countrymen.
Occasional trips to dine or sup in some of the thousand
Country-houses which are scattered round the environs of Paris,
serve to vary the scene. In the mean while the summer insensibly
glides away, and the fatal month of October approaches, when
I must exchange the house of Madame Necker for the house of
Commons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARIS BECOMING EMPTY.</div>

<p>I regret that I could not chuse the winter, instead of the
Summer, for this excursion: I should have found many valuable
persons, and should have preserved others whom I have lost as
I began to know them. The Duke de Choiseul, who deserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
attention both for himself, and for keeping the best house
in Paris, passes seven months of the year in Touraine; and
though I have been tempted, I consider with horror a journey
of sixty leagues into the Country. The Princess of Beauvau* (by
the bye Beauveau, fine calf, is an orthography worthy of a Sussex
farmer), the Princess of Beauvau, *who is a most superior
Woman, has been absent above six weeks, and does not return
till the 24<sup>th</sup> of this month. A large body of Recruits will be
assembled by the Fontainbleau journey; but in order [to] have a
thorough knowledge of this splendid Country, I ought to stay till
the month of January; and if I could be sure that opposition
would be as tranquil as they were last year&mdash;</p>

<p>I think your life has been as animated, or, at least, as
tumultuous, and I envy you Lady Payne,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> and Lady Dy, &amp;c.
much more than either the Primate,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> or the Chief Justice.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Let
not the generous breast of Mylady be torn by the black serpents
of envy. She still possesses the first place in the sentiments of
her slave: but the adventure of the fan was a mere accident,
owing to Lord Carmarthen. Adieu. I think you may be
satisfied. I say nothing of my terrestrial affairs.* Good works
are unnecessary, as I can only hope to be justified by my faith
in the merit of my Redeemer John Holroyd.</p>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Hotel de Modene à Paris, September the 1st, 1777.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam,</span>
</p>

<p>I must either write ten lines or twenty pages, and you
will easily judge which I shall prefer. The various sets of
company with whom I pass my time are so completely strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
to you, that before I mentioned any person of my acquaintance
I must introduce them with a very tedious yet imperfect account
of their birth, parentage, education and character. After all, what
would principally interest the curiosity of friendship may be
dispatched in two words&mdash;<em>I am well and happy</em>. Mr. Necker has
not yet discovered any signs of jealousy, and I supped last night
between two Arch-bishops who, I am persuaded, have not the least
intention of solliciting a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettre de cachet</i> to send me to the Bastille.
I only regret that it was not possible to choose another season of
the Year for my Expedition. In summer Paris is very far from
being a desert like London, and I have the daily pleasure of
living in a very numerous and agreeable Society, yet as there is
always a considerable emigration into the provinces I am sensible
that many valuable acquisitions have escaped me. In the first or
second week of October the Court goes to Fontainebleau, and as it
is never so full and splendid as in that place, I propose passing a
few days there. I must afterwards allow myself a little space to
thank and embrace my Paris friends: and shall return by the
first of November to a very different scene of things in London.</p>

<p>You will not be sorry to hear that, though I love the French
from inclination and gratitude, I have by no means lost my relish
for my native country. I have spent so much time in gay dissipation,
that I must set myself in good earnest to work; but you may
depend on my desire to steal a few days of the Christmas recess
for a Bath expedition. I fancy we shall have a busy Session of
Parliament, and unless Howe has very decisive success we shall
be less unanimous for the design of conquering America. I will
not trouble you with politics, but will only venture to assure you,
that, in the present moment, the French Counsels are seriously
inclined for peace. My friend Necker (for I now esteem and love
him on his own account) is declared principal minister of the
finances, and though he has great obstacles to contend with, his
knowledge, his firmness, and the purity of his intentions ought to
make us wish for his disgrace.</p>

<p>*I do not like this disorder on your eyes: and when I consider
your temperance and activity, I cannot understand why any spring
of the machine should ever be deranged. With regard to myself,
the Gout has behaved in a very honourable manner; after a
compleat conquest, and after making me feel his power for some
days, the generous Enemy has disdained to abuse his victory or
torment any longer an unresisting victim. He has already
ceased to torture the lower extremities of your humble servant;
the swelling is so amazingly diminished that they are no longer
above twice their ordinary size. Yesterday I moved about the
room with the laborious majesty of crutches; to-day I have
exchanged them for a stick; and by the beginning of next week,
I hope, with due precaution, to take the air and to inure myself for
the interesting representation of Thursday. How cursedly unlucky!

<p>I flatter myself that my long silence must have given
you great satisfaction. You recollect that while I was under the
tyranny of the Gout, I showed myself tolerably exact in sending
you intelligence of my situation and improvement. From my
silence therefore, you must have concluded that I am, now, as
indeed I am, restored to public health, and once more engaged in
the busy as well as idle dissipations of this great town. I jumped
at once from a sick chair into the warmest debates, which I ever
remember in my short parliamentary life. They have constantly
been fed by our miserable news from America, and the Session after
the holydays will be taken up by Committees on the state of the
Nation, Enquiries into the conduct of Ministers and Generals,
&amp;c., which will at least serve to increase the public ferment.
What will be the resolutions of our Governors I know not, but I
shall scarcely give my consent to exhaust still further the finest
country in the World in the prosecution of a war from whence no
reasonable man entertains any hopes of success. It is better to
be humbled than ruined.</p>

<p>Half my acquaintance, Lady Dy, Lady Payne, the Solicitor
General,<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> &amp;c., are running down to Bath for the holydays. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
I no other inducement I should certainly escape from the crowd,
and employ that short interval of quiet in resuming my long
neglected History. Those literary occupations however I would
gladly sacrifice to the pleasure of seeing you, but I apprehend I
shall be engaged to prefer the Sussex to the Bath journey by some
reasons which I will fairly submit to your judgement.</p>

<p>1. Holroyd, as you must have learned from his sister, is in a
very indifferent state of health. His eyes are affected, his spirits
are low, he has been disappointed of other company and he entreats
me in a very moving way not to abandon him on this occasion.</p>

<p>2. I wish to pass some time with him on my own account,
and to consult him with regard to Buriton, which is, I fear, very
indifferently treated by my tenant Winton.</p>

<p>3. I expect, without knowing the day, a French lady of
quality, Madame de Genlis,<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> to whom I have very great obligations.
Whenever she informs me of her arrival in London, I must
instantly fly (on the wings of mere friendship) to receive and
attend her: now it would be somewhat vexatious to travel an
hundred and ten miles, and to be called away the next day.
Determine for me, my dear friend, you have every tye upon me of
promise, of gratitude and of inclination. If you are not perfectly
satisfied with my positive engagement to pass the Easter recess
with you, depend upon it I will break through every difficulty
that detains me at present. I have a thousand things to hear
and say, and I know that you will enjoy, what I could not
perhaps say to others without incurring the censure of vanity.
If the Goulds are at Bath, I beg to be remembered to them. I
see your friend Mr. Melmoth<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> has published a translation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>

translator.</p>

Feb. 23, 1778.
</p>

<p>*You do not readily believe in præternatural miscarriages of
letters; nor I neither. Listen, however, to a plain and honest
narrative. This morning after breakfast, as I was ruminating
on <em>your</em> silence, Thomas, my new footman, with confusion in his
looks, and stammering on his tongue, produced a letter reasonably
soiled, which he was to have brought me the day of his arrival,
and which had lain forgotten from that time in his pocket. To
shorten as much as possible the continuance, I immediately
inquired, whether any method of conveyance could be devised
more expeditious than the post, and was fortunately informed
of your Coachman's intentions.* In your observations on the
opposition, &amp;c., I desiderate somewhat of your usual moderation.
I suppose you imagine that a reluctant effort of reason is at once
to efface past errors, to command present acquiescence, and to
inspire future confidence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATTEMPTS AT CONCILIATION.</div>

<p>*You probably know the heads of the plan; an act of
parliament, to declare that we never <em>had</em> any intention of taxing
America: another act, to empower the Crown to name commissioners,
authorized to suspend hostilities by sea and land,
as well as all obnoxious acts; and, in short, to grant every
thing, except Independence.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Opposition, after expressing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
doubts whether the lance of Achilles could cure the wound which
it had inflicted, could not refuse their assent to the principles of
conduct which they themselves had always recommended. Yet
you must acknowledge, that in a business of this magnitude
there may arise several important questions, which, without a
spirit of faction, will deserve to be debated: whether Parliament
ought not to name the Commissioners? whether it would not be
better to repeal the obnoxious acts ourselves? I do not find that
the World, that is, a few people whom I happen to converse with,
are much inclined to praise Lord N.'s ductility of temper. In
the service of next Friday,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> you will, however, take notice of the
injunction given by the Liturgy: "And all the people shall say
after the <em>minister</em>, Turn us again, O Lord, and so shall we be
turned."</p>

<p>While we considered whether we shall negociate, I fear
the French have been more diligent. It is positively asserted,
both in private and in Parliament, and not contradicted by the
Ministers, that on the 5th of this month a treaty of Commerce<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
(which naturally leads to a war) was signed at Paris with the
Independent States of America. What do you think of the
tardyness of administration? Yet there still remains a hope that
England may obtain the preference. The two greatest countries
in Europe are fairly running a race for the favour of America;*
and I fear our <em>Lord</em> has more bottom than foot. Adieu. Am
not I very good? but you must not expect a repetition of such
exalted Virtue. Your Eyes? I embrace My lady, &amp;c. I have

to-day. No <em>immediate</em> declaration expected on our side. A
Report (but vague) of an action in the bay, between La Motte
Piquet and Digby; the former has five ships and three frigates,
with three large store ships under convoy; the latter has eleven
ships of the line. If the Frenchman should sail to the mouth
of the Delawar, he may possibly be followed and shut up. When
Franklin was received at Versailles,<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Deane went in the same

a letter from Eliot at Berlin of the tenth instant, without any
mention of actual hostilities, and even speaking of the impending
War as not absolutely inevitable. Last Tuesday the first payment
of the loan £600,000 was certainly made; and as it would
otherwise be forfeited, it is a security for the remainder. I
have not yet got the intelligence you want, about former prices
of stock in Critical times. These are surely such. <em>Dixi. Vale.</em>

<div class="sidenote">HIS PRIVATE AFFAIRS.</div>

<p>The short delay of my answer, you must ascribe on this
occasion not to lazyness but to despondency. What a melancholy
prospect of public and private affairs. Excuse my saying
anything of the former (indeed there is nothing fixed or certain),
I am too much engaged by the latter.</p>

<p>What can I say about Fleet Street? The remittance they
mention from Hugonin, with another of a halfe year's rent from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Bucks, will diminish though not discharge the accruing interest
which indeed must always gain upon me, unless I could live
upon air. With regard to the principal, as they are in very
affluent circumstances, I did flatter myself that instead of urging
me to dispose of the dearest part of my property, the new River
share, at the most unfavourable season, they would have allowed
me the chance of another summer to dispose of Lenborough
which would ease me at once of principal and interest. I beg
you would make that earnest request to them, I mean to Clive,
and manage it with all the zeal and dexterity of your friendship.
Let me know, whether I can second it by any steps of politeness
and propriety. I had rather write than speak.&mdash;Should they
still be inflexible and rigourously exact the immediate sale of the
New River, give me your advice and assistance. Your <em>advice</em>
whether in honour and prudence, I may dispute the point and
gain time by the dilatory and expensive resources of the law.
If I ought to yield, your <em>advice</em> as to the best method of Sale.
Sure they cannot insist on my selling it much below its value.
I fear you must run to town for two or three days. With regard
to Buriton. Hugonin has sent me a letter for you unsealed.
I have kept it some days, without having courage to read it.
Is it very bad? I was much satisfied with your conference
with Winton, but can we depend on his promises? What
security have we between this time and Michaelmas for the
intentions of an attorney and the conduct of a madman.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear friend. My disposition is chearful, my wants

there is much kindness in that Jew and much good sense
likewise; he gives as good dinners as the superstition of the
females of his family will permit, and has a proper contempt
for all that a reasonable man ought to despise. I had destined
and shall give a <em>full</em> fortnight to Bath, and shall return to town

<p>Miss Holroyd who arrived here yesterday informed me
that you were certain that I could not be at S. P. as you had not
received any letter from me. This throws me under some difficulty,
since I must either set aside your authority or distrust the
evidence of my senses, which seems to tell me that I am actually
at the seat of J. B. Holroyd, Major of the Sussex Militia. The
aforesaid Major returned last night from his first sally, which had
lasted a whole week, during which time he left me Governor of
the Castle and Guardian of his fair Spouse. I acquitted myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of this great office in so satisfactory a manner, that I am again
invested with the same dignity, as the doughty Champion moves
forward to-morrow morng. on a second Expedition. The Regiment
is divided between Lewes and Brighthelmstone, and the
Duke of Richmond, &amp;c., works like a Serjeant, a clerk, and a
pack-horse. Their motions are irregular and uncertain, and if the
Major's quarters should be fixed at Brighthelmstone, My Lady and
Sarah will immediately march, and I shall follow the Camp, as
it is a place where I can enjoy studious leisure in the midst of
dissipation. If they are ordered to any other place I shall return
to my retirement in Bentinck Street, as at all events the 'decline
and fall' must proceed, which it does at present with tolerable
vigour.</p>

<p>Mr. Eliot, whom I saw in London as frequently as I
could, wished (if Plymouth and Port Eliot were not burnt down)
to receive me in September to meet Lord and Lady Ely. I
expressed gratitude but declined a promise. I should think the
journey a very proper one; but I must own that I neither like
the expence nor the loss of time. Yet those would sound like
paltry excuses after a six months' expedition to Paris.</p>

<p>The Major with our three Ladies, Abigail Holroyd, Sarah
Holroyd, and Catherine Porten, present their compliments to you.
We often talk you over, and this morning at Breakfast his
honour scolded sister for not bringing you with her; though on
calmer reflection we all thought it better that your second visit to
S. P. should be deferred to a more peaceable and settled time,
such as it may be hoped next year will prove. Sarah looks well;
several passages yesterday of the House, &amp;c., affected her a good

Russia. So much for the Republic.*</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>I think I grow worse and worse. I am sensible that you
are acquainted with my sentiments and my faults, and that you are
disposed to believe that the stream of my friendship is deep and
pure, though it flows <em>silently</em>, very silently indeed. Yet my conscience
whispers in my ear that I ought not to abuse the confidence
which you may with justice repose in me. My conscience,
likewise, informs me that as I made Sarah Holroyd the security
of my promise, she has a right to complain that she became in
some measure the accomplice of my quill. She has, I daresay,
given you a particular account of the way I spent the greatest
part of the summer; how, in the absence of the Major, I was left
Governor of the Castle and Director of the fair females who
inhabited it, and how I behaved myself in the execution of that
important office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISCOMFORTS OF BRIGHTON.</div>

<p>I went over to Brighthelmstone, but found not much encouragement
to settle, the Company was not agreeable, few of
my acquaintance except the Paynes and Beauclercs; more difficulty
and more expence than I expected in settling myself with
any degree of comfort, and great inconvenience in being so long
absent and distant from my tools. Upon mature consideration
I resolved to relinquish that plan and to retire for some time
to my rural retirement in Bentinck Street: the neighbourhood is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
not very populous at present, nor am I much interrupted by visits
or invitations; yet I find as much society as I want for relaxation;
and motives enough to engage me to take more exercise of a
morning than I should anywhere else; besides the occasional
Holydays which I sometimes allow myself to various friends who
dwell in villas adjacent to town. In the meantime I have the
pleasure to see the sheets of my second volume insensibly acquire
a respectable or at least a decent size; and though my progress
gives me a clearer view of the difficulties of my undertaking, yet
I find that gentle and steady diligence will in time carry me
through it: and I still look forwards to the spring of 1780 with
hope though not with confidence.</p>

<p>Before I left Sussex I visited, in company with the Major,
Cox Heath Camp: where I was received as a Father of the Old
Hampshire Militia, though few officers now remain in it, with
whom I have any connection. Jolliffe was returned to his
station of Ensign, with the <em>Cave</em> of General Keppel, who would
not however see him or forgive his extravagant behaviour, which
was much worse than anything you saw in the Papers. I am
afraid you were malicious enough to rejoyce at his absurdity.
While I was in the Camp, I felt my military ardour revive; but
I soon recollected that, notwithstanding the pleasure of passing
a part of the winter on the Down, my library is upon the whole
as agreeable as a Tent, and Almack's as comfortable as a Suttling
booth. What odd animals we are! I have deferred from post
to post, I am afraid to think how long, a very easy and pleasing
occupation, which has now made me pass a very agreeable half
hour in conversing with the dearest and most valued of my
friends; who will derive some pleasure from the conversation.
I positively believe I shall reform.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Before I conclude I must add three words on a subject which
is not so entertaining. You know how little I love to talk about
business, but I ought not to omit what you will probably hear
from some other quarter. My tenant Winton had done <em>some</em>
mischief to Buriton; he threatened to injure it much more deeply,
and I was persuaded by my Council to get rid of him, which I
have just accomplished. Till the farm is let again, which I hope
will be soon, Hugonin has undertaken the temporary administration.
I have lost considerably in taking leave of my old
tenant, and fear my loss in engaging a new one will be still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
considerable, and I can ill support these extraordinary demands.
Yet I should consider that, if all external circumstances were as
smooth and satisfactory as the temper of my own mind, my
condition would be too fortunate.</p>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Bentinck Street, Jan. 7th, 1779.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>You will pity rather than blame me when I tell you
that all last week I have been a good deal indisposed. The
changes of weather brought a severe cold, accompanied with some
degree of fever. I was confined to my room several days, and
the state of my spirits as well as that of my health would have
rendered the effort of writing very painful to me. The effort
would have been still more painful with regard to the subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
your two last letters. I feel your happiness so much connected
with mine, that the account of your sentiments and situation
must disturb the enjoyments and encrease the anxiety of my own
life. I feel it the more deeply as I am sensible that it is not in
my power to remove the two causes of your present uneasiness.</p>

<p>I know not how to offer advice, and I am incapable of giving
any efficacious help. I have easily perceived in my successive
visits to Bath that a dislike of the place, of public life, and of
mixed Society was insensibly gaining ground in your mind: and
as I know that our happiness must always depend on our opinions
and habits, I never presumed to prescribe for the constitution of
another. Business and pleasure, Society or no Society, town or
country, have undoubtedly their respective merits, and every one
must on those subjects think and judge and act for themselves.
The gay hurry of Bath or the silent retirement of Mrs. Massey's in
Essex may alike be enjoyed by the mind to which they are adapted,
and the only advice which I could think of offering, would be,
not to engage yourself rashly in a connection of which you might
afterwards repent. I have always considered marriage as a very
serious undertaking, and the agreement of any friends to live
together in the same house is a sort of marriage. If they have
passed several years in different modes of life, their manners,
their opinions, their sentiments on almost every subject must
have contracted a different colour, and every little circumstance
of hours, &amp;c., will prove the cause of mutual restraint or mutual
dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>But I now find, what indeed I have sometimes feared, that
your design of retiring from Bath is not entirely the effect of
choice and inclination; that a stronger power, the power of
necessity or at least of prudence, urges you to take that resolution,
and that in a word you find the place too expensive. You
do not explicitly say what income would support your present
establishment, and I am not so stupid or so ungrateful as not
to feel the generous delicacy of your behaviour. If my own
circumstances were affluent, the obligations and friendship of
twenty years would instantly prompt me to gratify my own
inclinations in the performance of sacred duty. I am not insensible
that in my present situation, you have a substantial and
even legal claim upon me to a very considerable amount, and
while I feel the value of your tenderness on this occasion, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
must lament that it is not in my power to attain even the humble
though indispensable virtue of Justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LESS INCOME THAN EXPENSES.</div>

<p>Without recurring to any recollections which would be painful
to us both, I may appeal to the anxious regard which you have
always felt and expressed for my interest. You know the distressed
embarrassed situation in which my affairs were left, and
though I have always been directed by the advice of Mr. H.,
I have hitherto been disappointed in every attempt to extricate
myself by the sale of Lenborough Estate. The prospect of public
affairs and the universal want of money forces me at present
to suspend every idea of a sale, and all credit is so compleatly
dead, that in the most pressing exigency I should be at a loss
how to borrow a thousand pounds. In the mean time I have
been paying five per Cent. interest on a Estate which hardly
produced three per Cent.; and in the very moment when I
could the least afford it, the madness of my Buriton tenant has
involved me in new scenes of vexation and expence. My desires
have always been moderate and my domestic economy has been
conducted with tolerable prudence. Yet my income has never
been quite adequate to my expences, and those expences, unless
I retired from Parliament&mdash;from London and from England&mdash;it
would be impossible for me to retrench. When I look back
I cannot find much to censure or regret in my own conduct,
but when I look forwards, I am sometimes alarmed and perplexed.
I should indeed find room to despond, if my spirits were not
supported by the resources which I derive from my litterary
character, and by the well grounded hopes which I build on
the assistance of a tried and powerful friend.</p>

<p>I cannot on <em>this</em> head explain myself more particularly by
letter, but I have the strongest reasons to believe that the year
which we have just begun will not end without producing a
material improvement in my situation. If you have not already
taken any decisive steps about leaving Bath, I could wish
that you would suspend them till I can have the pleasure of
conversing with you in the Easter holidays. If you still persist
in your design, why should you bury yourself at Mrs. Massey's?
Some pleasant village retirement at a moderate distance from
London, where I could frequently visit you, might be consistent
with your plan of expence, and you might there find yourself at
once delivered from the costly and tasteless vanities of a fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
life. Whatever resolution you adopt, let me hear from you soon,
and always believe me with the most unalterable affection,</p>

<p class="signature">
Ever yours,<br />
E. G.
</p>

<p>I can say nothing of public affairs. Men of all parties&mdash;Ministers
themselves&mdash;think them bad enough; but I do assure
you that I have not any claims to the injurious epithet of 'a
Patriot.' The apprehension of a Dutch War, though it is now
blown over, was real and serious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROSPECT OF A PLACE.</div>

<p>As we are mutually convinced of each other's sentiments,
words, compliments, assurances would be as idle as they are
useless: yet it would be incumbent on me to employ them, if
they became either of us; since I am so unfortunate as to be
reduced to those equivocal marks of regard, whilst I receive from
you the most solid and substantial proofs of that friendship and
real affection which I have invariably experienced above twenty
years.&mdash;You ask me why I should wish you to wait till Easter,
and you seem desirous of an explanation of the latter part of my
letter. It is for that very purpose of an explanation that I
desired that delay, as it includes a variety of circumstances which
I ought not to trust to paper or to the post. I can only say in
general that from the assistance of a very powerful friend I have
room to hope that I may soon be placed in an honourable and
advantageous post<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> either at home or abroad, which would enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
me to satisfy my duty as well as inclination by making your
residence at Bath easy and comfortable to you in the manner you
yourself have calculated your expences. I am not of a sanguine
temper, and I am very sensible that besides the usual grounds
of doubt and distrust, there are many circumstances which it is
impossible for me to explain, that may either forward or delay
or entirely disappoint the most rational expectations. Last week
things seemed to draw so very near a crisis that I suspended
my letter in hopes of making it more satisfactory to you and to
myself. At present they are rather thrown back, and for aught
I know the present Session of Parliament may end in darkness
and uncertainty. Yet, I think the chance is worth waiting for
a few months, perhaps somewhat longer; the difference of your
income and expence cannot be very important, and if you do not
wish me to make a difficult effort, I cannot see any great mischief
in your eating a little deeper into your principal. I am the more
anxious that you should not hastily quit a place which upon the
whole must suit you better than any other; not only because I
hope it will not be necessary, but as I am sure in your indifferent
state of health, the unpleasant removal would be attended with
fatigue of body and anxiety of mind which might be very
prejudicial to you.</p>

<p>I am much flattered by your approbation of my pamphlet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
It was a disagreeable but a necessary step, after which I take my
absolute and final leave of controversy. My second volume
advances, and I hope will be finished within the <em>ensuing</em> year
(1780). You were right as to the benefit I have derived from
the first; under the pressure of various difficulties, it proved a
seasonable and useful friend; but if it supported, it did not enrich
its author. I did not send a copy of my vindication to Port
Eliot, nor indeed to any person except to yourself. Eliot must
be in town in a fortnight to a very severe call of the House.
I have meditated a letter to him, or rather to Mrs. E., above
three months without success.</p>

<p class="head">
Bentinck Street, 21st March, 1779.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>If your former letters made me uneasy, your last note,
which I received yesterday after the hour of the post, made me
quite unhappy for many reasons; but most of all because I found
that you were so yourself. The delay in my answer which has
given you so much pain, was not occasioned by any avocations of
business, for there could be no business which interested me half
so much; nor by any carelessness or forgetfulness, for I can say
with truth that there has not been any hour in the day and very
few in the night in which the idea was not uppermost in my mind.
Much less did it arise from any degree of resentment at any part
of your behaviour. I had expressed myself with some warmth,
I wrote from my feelings, and I was apprehensive of some
alteration in your sentiments towards me. Had I been cold and
indifferent myself, I should probably have been more cautious
and respectful.</p>

<p>Yet unless I totally forget the language of my letter, I
did not, I could not, disapprove of your consulting your own
happiness, and of calling on me after so long a respite to fulfil
some part of the most equitable obligation. The cause of my
delay was a strong, an unjustifiable repugnance to write on a
subject so foreign to our ordinary conversations. I dreaded
and I delayed too long so painful an effort. As I am now sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
how uneasy that delay has made you, I have taken the shortest
method of sending, that of the coach. Forgive this seeming
inattention, and believe me when I say that the affectionate
regard, the tender solicitude which you express, have made an
essential part of the happiness, and will always contribute to the
consolation of my life.</p>

<p>I find that I must have stated rather too strongly the difficulties
of my situation so as to alarm and terrify you, both on
your account and on my own. I will endeavour to represent
them more clearly. I have never been extravagant; nor have
I made as yet any <em>considerable</em> addition to the load of debt contracted
by my father: but I have not been able to discharge it.
The unhappy accidents which retarded the sale of Lenborough,
have been attended, from the general hardships of the times,
with the most fatal consequences, as land cannot at present be
sold even on the most disadvantageous terms. In the course of
seven or eight years interest has been much higher than rent, my
Expences (notwithstanding the supply of some hundred pounds
from my book) have inevitably exceeded my income.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS PLANS OF ECONOMY.</div>

<p>You are sensible from your own experience that any plan of
economy must be regulated by place and circumstances. As long
as I am in London and in Parliament, a house in Bentinck
Street, a coach, such a proportion of servants, clothes, living, &amp;c.,
are almost necessaries. But they are only necessaries in that
situation, and I am not ignorant that a prudent man should
adapt his arrangements to his fortune. Other countries of a less
expensive cost, France, Switzerland, or perhaps Scotland, may
afford an humble Philosophical retreat to a man of letters, nor
should I suffer any accidental change of fortune, any fall in the
World to affect my spirits or ruffle my tranquility. I have more
than once balanced in my own mind the propriety, or indeed the
necessity of such a resolution. The reason which induces me to
suspend such an important and decisive measure arises from a
hope which I could only insinuate and which I can at present
only imperfectly explain. I can only mention that I am particularly
connected with the present Attorney General, that he
solicited my friendship, and offered me his services; and that if
some arrangement should take place which would raise him to
a much higher station, I may depend on a seat at one of the
boards with an additional income of £1000 a year, which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
remove every difficulty and supply every want. Without building
on a doubtful foundation, inclination and even prudence recommend
that I should wait some time for the event of this hope:
and my only request is that you would on your side suspend any
resolution of leaving Bath for some months, perhaps for a year.
The difference of the expence in a year would not exceed £100,
which you may command whenever (with a few days' notice) you
will draw upon me.</p>

<p>If my expectations should deceive me (and I am never
sanguine) my party is taken. I feel with gratitude and confusion
your kind offer of retiring for my sake: but independent
of every other consideration, it is far more proper that the
unpleasant circumstances of such a removal should fall on
the person who has health and youth and spirits to support
them. With regard to any further <em>security</em>, I should have
imagined that in the ordinary course of credit, my Bond was
a very good security to the amount of the sum: but I am ready
to consent to any act which you may consider as conducive to
your interest or happiness.&mdash;I much fear that the agitation of
mind may have injured your health before its perfect recovery
from your late accident, and if a single word which I have written
has tended to produce that effect, I shall not easily forgive myself.
Though I cannot bear the thought of your quitting Bath against
your inclinations, I should imagine that in the summer months,
the air of the country would be beneficial to you. Whether you
choose Port Eliot, Sheffield, Essex or any other place, I will, if
my company can be any pleasure or relief to you, lay aside every
other occupation to accompany you.</p>

<p>I am glad you have exerted some diligence about Mrs. G.'s
Estate, but I wish you could have prevented a letter which I
have just received, and which like a true coward I send you
unopened. I fear it contains sharp or dry reproach for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>

entitled to her gratitude, and cannot be afraid of her displeasure.
No time should be lost, therefore return her Epistle with the
aforesaid ostensible letter. I do not go to Bath this Easter; and
Mrs. Gibbon is now satisfied with my conduct and correspondence.
Some journey or arrangement to see her must be thought of in
the course of the summer, but at present it would be highly
inconvenient, our respite is little more than a week, and besides
the approaching hurry of Parliamentary business, of which there
is a large provision, I am now deeply and not unsuccessfully
engaged in the decline and fall; and I <em>do not totally despair</em> of

<p>We are now, after a very short recess, engaged in a
great hurry of business, which will probably last a great while.
I find however time, and a good deal of time (without fatiguing
myself too much), for the occupation which after all is the
pleasure, and I hope, the honour of my life. In your last letter
you ask whether your remaining at Bath is necessary to my
tranquility. I can answer that question in the clearest manner,
and, while I answer it, I must feel with gratitude how kindly
it is proposed. It <em>is</em> necessary for my happiness that you should
not be <em>forced</em> to leave Bath by any difficulties which it would be
my duty to remove: nor could I enjoy the comfort of any
situation which was purchased at the expence of your ease and
happiness. But if your retiring from Bath was the effect of your
own inclination, it is impossible that I could be hurt at your
leaving a place which I should never visit but on your account;
and I should visit you with at least as much pleasure in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
country retirement as in that scene of (what has always appeared
to me) very awkward gaiety. But surely it is better to suspend
any decisive resolution for the present. I was happy to hear

<p>It is almost ridiculous for so hardened a sinner as
myself to assign any particular reason for his silence and
negligence: Yet I can say with truth that I do not remember
the time when I have been more fully engaged. The attendance
of the House of Commons on our fruitless, hopeless enquiries is
really severe at this unseasonable time of year, and my literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>

weighed every circumstance and am prepared for every possible

and I give you <em>my honour</em> that I will make such arrangements

<p>I have the pleasure of acquainting you, that I am
now appointed one of the Lords of Trade in the room of Bamber
Gascoyne;<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Andrew Stuart<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> has succeeded at the same time to

of saying that in both instances they have gained by the exchange.
As the salary of this place will secure and improve my own
situation, so I really set much more value upon it, as it will
enable me to discharge a small part of my debt of duty and
gratitude towards you. For the future you may depend on
receiving the interest of the Bond (at 5 per cent.) which will
make the two half yearly payments £150 instead of £100 each;
and will I hope be sufficient to support your establishment at
Bath in a manner more agreeable to you. I have only to beg
a short respite, and that you would be satisfied with the usual
draught at present and the double (£200) at next Christmas.
At the moment my increase of fortune encreases my actual
poverty. Sir Francis Wronghead<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> was perfectly in the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
when he said, "Mayhap I may not receive the first quarter of
my salary this halfe yeare:" he might have added that the heavy
fees of offices eat up the greatest part of it, and that a space
of some months must elapse before the stream begins to flow
regularly and beneficially. I am not insensible that this addition
of income is of a very precarious nature, and that the event of an
hour or the caprice of a man may throw me back into my former
anxiety, but the alteration shall never affect your happiness or
situation, and the plan of retirement into Switzerland with my
friend d'Eyverdun which I had perfectly considered and digested
will be a resource not unworthy of a Philosopher, which I shall
always have it in my power to command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LORD OF TRADE.</div>

<p>I am now going to resume my literary employments, which
have suffered a short interruption, and I shall resume them, if
not with more tranquility at least with more cheerfulness of mind.
I find myself however under a difficulty of reconciling two plans
for this year, each of which is equally recommended by my
interest, my duty and my inclination. On the one hand I
anxiously desire to publish the continuation of my history about
this time twelvemonth. Though much is already done, much
still remains to do, and I should almost despair of being able
to finish so large a task, unless I steadily proceed without losing
a day, or unless I compensate any intervals of negligence by
extraordinary and improper efforts of industry. This important
object seems to confine me to Bentinck Street and my Library:
but on the other hand I am desirous and even impatient to visit
you at Bath; to carry you down to Port Eliot, where I am sure
the air and society would be your best Physician, to see Mrs.
Eliot, and to convince <em>him</em> of the grateful sense that I entertain
of his behaviour in consenting to my re-election,<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> which I know
was highly unpleasant to him. I shall endeavour to concert
measures in such a manner as to reconcile those opposite views:
but I foresee that the execution of such a scheme can only
become practicable towards the Autumn.</p>

<p>I ought to make some apology for leaving some days in
anxious suspence. I can only say, that I was myself in the same
condition. Every morning I expected the event of the evening,
and every evening the return of the morning. Till the business
was absolutely finished, a hundred accidents might have dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
the cup from my lips, and I was afraid of raising your hopes only
to embitter the melancholy news which might have followed.</p>

myself so much more susceptible of private friendship than of
public spirit, that I am very well satisfied with that conclusion.
My summer has been passed in the town and neighbourhood,
which I still maintain to be the best society, and the best

very far from being in a good state of health or spirits, but I
am not Physician enough to distinguish between the influence of
the body and that of the mind: he feels for the public with the
most exquisite sensibility, and all his sentiments are of the painful
kind. He still loiters in town, which I dare say he will not
leave till near the meeting of Parliament, and will go about the
month of November to pass the <em>Summer</em> in Cornwall. His
delay has disconcerted my measures, as I had resolved (however
inconvenient it might be) to make an Expedition this year to
Port Eliot; and had proposed myself the pleasure of passing
some days at Bath on my way. Cornwall must be deferred

<p>Whenever you have desired an immediate answer you
have not found me very negligent; it is therefore incumbent on
me to explain my <em>apparent</em> tardiness which was occasioned by a
visit to Tunbridge. Your letter was sent there the day after I

your second Epistle to write by to-night's post.</p>

<p>The officious intelligence which was communicated, I suppose,
from Sheffield Place to Bath, alarmed your tenderness much more
than was necessary about the state of my health. A Derangement
in my stomach which seemed of the bilious kind determined
me to return to town in search of advice. Turton was divided for
two or three days between the probability of Jaundice and Gout,
but either Nature or his skill preserved me from both; and I am
now perfectly free from all complaints and apprehensions whatsoever.

<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>This day I dined in Conduit Street, a well-furnished
house, good table, proper attendance, &amp;c. Thus far you will say
there was nothing very extraordinary. But the Lady of the
house was Mrs. Williams, alias Bell Mallet. Her aunt Elstob is
just dead, and has left her that house, furniture, plate, &amp;c., with
a fortune (as Mr. Scott tells me) of £14,000 chargeable only with
an Annuity of £100 a year to her sister during her mother's life.
She is in high spirits, as she well may be, very French, but really
agreeable and even handsome. She talks of settling her affairs
and returning to France. Her husband is at New York much
esteemed in his profession, and she may be very happy if he does
not <em>now</em> recollect his wife, though Mrs. Elstob, by appointing
Trustees, George Scott and Mr. Waller, has taken every possible
measure to secure her fortune from him. I thought you would
not be sorry to hear something of that little animal, who came to
town only Saturday and sent to me only last night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS OFFICIAL DUTIES.</div>

<p>Nothing has given me for a long while more real
uneasiness than the doubt, which I am now obliged to express,
whether it will be in my power to pass my Holydays at Bath.
After so long a delay and such repeated disappointments, I had
promised myself much pleasure, I may say happiness, in spending
some few days with you at a time when every disagreeable circumstance
was removed and our domestic prospect was become more
cheerful. But the advantages of office must be accepted with
some inconveniences. You know how much the Irish business
engages our attention and fears at this moment, and you will see
by the papers that Lord North has proposed some very important
alterations with regard to the commerce of that country.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> The
bills for that purpose will pass in Parliament, but there still
remains a great number of subordinate circumstances, though
highly essential to be regulated, and which in some form will be
referred to the Board of Trade. We shall be forced to sit almost
every day during the Recess, and the absence of a <em>new Lord</em> on
the occasion would be thought peculiarly improper.</p>

<p>There is even another motive which I cannot explain, which
will I hope make my attention to this business of some future
benefit to the public or at least to myself. These reasons will
satisfy the delicacy of your friendship, but I beg you would keep
them to yourself, as I abhor and despise above all things the
seeming affectation of official importance. Only be persuaded
that I feel the delay (as I fear it must prove) of my visit,
not less disagreeably than you do yourself.</p>

<p>I have seen very little of Mrs. Williams, and am sorry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
indeed surprised to hear so bad an account of a little coquette
to whom I only imputed the venial faults of vanity and affectation.
I understand she is already on the Wing. Mr. Eliot
is still in town: we all try to push him down to Bath; he
seems immoveable; but he appears in somewhat better health
and spirits. He deplores the state of public affairs, past, present
and future. With regard to the last, though from different
principles, I am afraid that his apprehensions are not imaginary,
and the impending dangers from war and faction are most
alarming. I never knew anything equal to the violence of this
Session of Parliament, which has not left me a moment of
peace or leisure. Adieu! dear Madam, I do most seriously
<em>intend</em> to write again very soon. Your <em>ordinary</em> remittance shall
reach you on Christmas-day, and I hope that I shall be able to
add the <em>extraordinary</em> or rather the new one. But my own
supplies, both from Hampshire and from the Exchequer, come
in so very slowly that I may be obliged to defer the second £100
till the end of January in case it should not be inconvenient
to you.</p>

real friendship, which he feels and expresses warmly; on this
occasion, I hope, it will be successfully, and that in a few days you
will find yourself among us at St. Stephen's in the heat of the
battle. But you know that I am a dastardly, pusillanimous spirit,
more inclined to fear than to hope, and not very eager in the
pursuit of <em>expensive</em> Vanity. On this vacancy the celerity of your
motions may probably prevent opposition; but at the general
election, your enemy, the Corporation, will not be asleep, and I
wish, if it be not too late, to warn you against any promises or
engagements which may terminate in a defeat, or at least a
Contest of ten thousand pounds. Adieu. I could believe
(without seeing it under her paw) that my lady wishes to leave
Coventry. No news! foreign or domestic. I did not forget to
mention the <em>Companies</em>, but find people, as I expected, torpid.

were separated and forced by an unlucky gale of wind into the
Port of Cadiz. The letters from thence express despondency and
fears (which for us are hopes) of several other ships. Patriots

<p>*When you awakened me with your pen, it was my
intention to have shown some signs of life by the next post. But
so uncertain are all human affairs, that I found myself arrested
by a mighty unrelenting Tyrant, called the Gout; and though my
feet were the part on which he chose to exercise his cruelty, he
left me neither strength nor spirits to use my hand in relating
the melancholy tale. At present I have the pleasure of informing
you, that the feaver and inflammation have subsided; but the
absolute weakness and monstrous swelling of my two feet confine
me to my chair and flannels; and this confinement most unluckily
happens at a very <em>nice</em> and important moment of Parliamentary
affairs. Col. Holroyd pursues those affairs with eager and
persevering zeal; and has the pleasure of undertaking more
business than any three men could possibly execute.* He is much
obliged to you for your kind congratulation. Mrs. Eliot is in

themselves) of their intentions. I will write again very soon.</p>

<p>If I had written as I intended three or four posts ago,
I should have informed you that Turton and myself were very
well satisfied with the proceedings of the Gout, that he had
behaved like a fair and honourable enemy, and that after making
me sensible of his power, he was taking leave in a gentle and
orderly manner. I cannot send you at present quite so favourable
an account; the Gout has seriously returned into one of my feet;
the pair kept me sleepless last night; and I have been low and
weak all day. I can easily understand this alteration, and you
will not be surprized when you hear that I was forced to go out
rather too soon, and to sit up two whole nights in the House of
Commons. You will see by the Papers, that a Vote has passed
against the Board of Trade,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> but I can assure you that it has not

<div class="sidenote">RECOVERY FROM THE GOUT.</div>

<p>I should not have left you in suspense, if the Gout had
not treated me exactly in the same manner. My journal (had I
sent one every post) could only have specified its irregular motions
from one place and from one foot to another; swelling, inflammation,
weakness, pain increasing, diminishing, shifting, &amp;c.:
and the alternative of good and bad nights; sometimes forcing
myself out of doors and sometimes nursing myself at home.
However the real violence of the fit such as it was during the
first week or ten days has never returned, there has not at any
time been the slightest symptom or most distant hint in any part
except the feet, and I now hope that it is seriously and finally
going away. The short interval of the holidays (short indeed,
for Parliament meets again to-morrow Sennight) may give me
strength and spirits to support a scene which I am heartily tired
of. We must again submit to our common disappointment, and
if the decline and fall make you any amends you will be glad
to hear that the continuation (two quarto volumes) goes to the

<p>Your kind epistle gave me much more pleasure than
pain; for I am grown callous to shame, but am not insensible of
gratitude and friendship.</p>

<p>I have heard of you by Mrs. Sarah Holroyd, and was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
pleased and edified by the zeal with which you communicated to
your family the Colonel's first spirited Oration.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> He instantly
exclaimed, 'Those are the friends I like to have.' He has not
spoke since, but he is, as you may well suppose, indefatigable and
eager, and it will not be long before he feels a second inspiration.
I can only condole with you that a person, in whose fate and
reputation you are perhaps more deeply interested, should still
continue a dumb dog. He has indeed the grace to acknowledge
his infirmity, and if my seat in the House of C. had not some
remote connection with a more valuable seat, I should retire
without any regret from that scene of noise, heat and contention.
A dissolution of Parliament, though it may be delayed many
months, is by many expected every hour: and I am totally
ignorant of the designs of the Electors of Liskeard. My great
constituent grows warmer in patriotism, but he still expresses the
same regard for me, and though I have no motives for confidence,
I have not any reasons for fear. He is perfectly silent on the
subject, and I am prepared for the worst. I saw my young friend
John in his passage, and was indeed astonished by the sense and
propriety of his behaviour without embarrassment and without
forwardness. Mrs. Eliot is not in the least altered.</p>

All tumult has perfectly subsided, and we only think of the

seasonable and vigorous; and even opposition has been forced to
confess, that the military force was applied and regulated with
the utmost propriety. Our danger is at an end, but our disgrace
will be lasting, and the month of June 1780, will ever be marked
by a dark and diabolical fanaticism, which I had supposed to be

excuse either my past silence or my present importunity. The
former has not been the effect of presumption, nor does the latter
proceed from any want of confidence in your friendship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNCERTAINTY OF HIS SEAT.</div>

<p>It seems to be universally understood that this parliament
will be dissolved in a few months and perhaps in a few days&mdash;and
you are not ignorant how much the whole colour of my
future life depends on your resolution. Unless I obtain a seat
in the next parliament, I cannot flatter myself with a hope of
remaining at the board of trade; such is the unpleasant state of
my private affairs, that I must resign with my office all prospect
of living in England, and the discontinuance of your favours will
therefore be a sentence of banishment from my native country.
My firm assurance that your kindness will allow some weight to
these personal considerations will teach me to acquiesce, whatever
may be your designs, with sincere and grateful resignation. I
could not even lament that I was not sooner apprized of your
intention to withdraw this mark of your friendship at the time
when it became the most valuable. The largest notice would not
perhaps have enabled me to take any other measures for the
attainment of the same object, and your silence, though it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
have excited some anxious thoughts or nourished some delusive
hopes, has not made any real difference in my situation.</p>

<p>It gives me pain at the same time to mention another topic.
Various circumstances of public and private distress have hitherto
prevented me from disposing of my Buckinghamshire Estate,
from whence I may expect to derive a considerable supply, and
I shall find myself under the necessity of soliciting your indulgence
till I can discharge what I shall always esteem a very small part
of my obligations.</p>

day after your departure pressed and persuaded me to make a
bold application to the powers above. I fairly stated my public
disappointment and private difficulties, and declared to Lord N.
in the most explicit terms, that notwithstanding my sincere desire
to replace myself in a situation, where I may be serviceable to his
Government, <em>small indeed</em> must be the effort which I shall be
capable of making for that purpose, an idea which I explained
to Robinson in a more familiar tone, by asking for an <em>almost</em>
gratuitous seat. After some importunity and delay, I saw the
Secretary yesterday; and he communicated Lord N.'s resolution
of bringing me into Parliament, either for the first meeting, or at
the Re-Elections which will immediately be occasioned by the
option of those who are returned for two places. He did not
mention terms; if any, they must be very light. On my return
home I found a letter from Lord L[oughborough]<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>

will growl if I lament in some sort that it has disconcerted a very
pleasant scheme, a sweet vision of <em>Helvetic</em> retirement: I know
that a prudent man ought not to make himself happy.</p>

Lincoln; he is disliked by the substantial tradesmen: but they

<p class="head">
B. S., Sept. 8th, 1780.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>I have not attempted to shake your decided resolutions
nor shall I presume to arraign the consistency of the Electors of
Leskeard, whom you so gravely introduce. You are undoubtedly
free as air to confer and to withdraw your parliamentary favours,
and I should despise my own ingratitude were I capable of
forgetting my past obligations to you because you are not disposed
to render them more perfect, or more permanent. I am
still ignorant what will be the consequences of your refusal; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
I declare upon my honour, at the date of my last letter that they
appeared to me exactly in the light in which I represented them,
that I had never formed any hopes much less any claims of
ministerial support, and that I never opened my lips on the
subject to the noble friend whose character seems to extort the
praise of his political enemies. Since your absolute refusal, I
have been encouraged to hazard an application which has been
kindly entertained. If it proves unsuccessful the principal difficulty
will arise from the lateness of my request. I am asked
why Mr. Eliot, who re-elected a placeman last year, maintained to
the last moment an ambiguous silence without condescending to
inform me that I must not depend on his friendship at the
General Election. I confess that I am at a loss for an answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFENCE OF HIS CONDUCT IN PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p>I am equally at a loss how to answer the part of your letter,
which in polite language represents my parliamentary conduct
as the cause of your displeasure. You will not expect that I
should justify the grounds of every silent vote which I have
given, or that I should write a political pamphlet on the eventful
history of the last six years. But I may fairly rest my apology
on the truth of one single assertion, that I have never renounced
any principle, deserted any connection, or violated any promise.
I have uniformly asserted both in private and public the justice
of the American War. I have constantly supported in Parliament
the general measures of Government, except at one particular
crisis while it was doubtful, after Bourgoyne's defeat whether
they would offer terms to the rebels. I agreed with you in a
speculative opinion, almost equally rejected by both parties, that
after the substance of power was lost, the name of independence
might be granted to the Americans. I have often and severely
censured the faults of administration, but I have always condemned
the <em>system</em> of opposition: and your judgment will allow
that in public life, every man is reduced to the necessity of
choosing the side which upon the whole appears to him the least
reprehensible. The mere acceptance of a seat at the board of
trade does not surely convey any reproach or disgrace, since you
yourself, my Dear Sir, have held the same disqualifying place under
several successive Administrations, without any of those domestic
reasons, which, if an excuse were necessary, might be alleged in
my favour. You revive an old conversation between us concerning
Mr. Peachey's election, which passed, if I am not mistaken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
in the garret of the House of Commons. At that time I had
never given a single vote against the actual measures of Government,
and the indiscreet opinion which you urged me to declare
must apply to your sentiments, not to my own. I thought and
I still think, that, were I master of a Borough, I would not from
motives of interest, elect a <em>stranger</em> whose political principles were
repugnant to my own.</p>

<p>Thus far for my own honour, I have been forced into this
unpleasant, though I hope not intemperate explanation, but I
perfectly concur with your wish to avoid all future complaints or
apologies. I most willingly embrace the offer of your private
friendship, and I shall always cultivate a cordial intercourse with
a person who is entitled to my esteem and gratitude.</p>

<p>I beg you would present my kindest wishes and compliments
to Mrs. Eliot and the rest of your family. I suppose Mr. Edward
will succeed me at Leskeard.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>I have delayed answering your kind enquiry about my
seat in Parliament, till I should be able to say something satisfactory
and positive. Had Mr. Eliot been explicit some months
since, another arrangement would have been made without difficulty.
His silence has occasioned some delay, but I have the
strongest reason to believe that I shall be again in the House of
Commons before Christmas. I expect the event with the most
tranquil indifference: I am heartily tired of the place, and if
such indulgence were compatible with my situation and prospects
I should be glad to find myself released from such troublesome
attendance. Your anxiety lest any coldness should arise between
Mr. E. and me will, I hope, prove groundless. I have nothing to
reproach myself, I do not reproach him, and from the letters
which have passed between us, I should imagine that we shall
meet next winter on proper terms of friendship and civility.
You see by the Gazette that Langlois<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> is dismissed; and he himself

<div class="sidenote">RECEPTION OF HIS NEW VOLUMES.</div>

<p>I am always obliged to you for waking me by a friendly
pinch from my silent lethargy, and I think it most prudent to
write before I fall asleep again.</p>

<p>An author must always begin on the subject of his own work,
the subject always most interesting to himself, but on this occasion
he may assume the privilege of friendship and justly believe that
it is not less interesting to you. Your praise has afforded me
real satisfaction, not only because I wish to please you, but as
I do not know any person (where questions of pure learning are
concerned) from whose approbation I should derive more pride.
To speak frankly, I am of your opinion with regard to the
improvement of the style, nor is it very surprizing that my long
practice should make a workman more expert and ready at his
trade. I am curious to learn what passage in Prior you have
in your eye: but as the works of that agreeable Poet are not
extremely familiar to me, the resemblance is more probably the
effect of chance than of design. The reception of these two
volumes has been very unlike that of the first, and yet my vanity
is so very dextrous, that I am not displeased with the difference.
The effects of novelty could no longer operate, and the public was
not surprized by the unexpected appearance of a new and unknown
author. The progress of these two volumes has hitherto been
quiet and silent. Almost everybody that reads has purchased,
but few persons (comparatively) have read them; and I find that
the greater number, satisfied that they have acquired a valuable
fund of entertainment, differ the perusal to the summer, the
country and a more quiet period. Yet I have reason to think,
from the opinion of some judges, that my reputation has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>

of total loss of character) commend my decency and moderation:

just dead, without leaving her anything, at which Hester expresses
more resentment than seems becoming in the character of a Saint.
She is still healthy and sensible, refuses as formerly to enter my
house, but appears pleased with my attentions, and those of Mrs.
and Lady Porten and of Lord and Lady Sheffield, who have all
visited her in Surrey Street. She enquired civilly and even quietly
into your situation, and approved the sentiments which naturally
fell from me.&mdash;When I sent you my book I likewise despatched
another with a very polite letter to Port Eliot&mdash;A dead silence&mdash;I
accidentally called in Spring Gardens to visit the son, and heard
that the father had been three weeks or a month in town. I

dead silence of four days terminated only by a mute, blank, formal
visit. Mrs. Eliot however (they are an odd family) has called

attack of the gout, and I rejoyce to hear that you revive with the
Spring. A friend like Mrs. P. was a real loss, and I think with
you that in such an intimate connection the heart is of much
more importance than the head. Embrace in my name Sara and
the tame cat. I hope the former is not offended with, and I am
persuaded that the latter adores, me, but am much disappointed
that her Bath residence has not produced any shining adventures:
a pair of small, neat horns might peep very gracefully out of a
laurel crown, which her husband well deserves, though I think
with you that his effusions are too frequent and precipitate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
Adieu, dear Madam. I am still ignorant and indeed indifferent
about the precise moment of my parliamentary beatification.
Lord S. is chaired next Monday at Coventry; but it is needless
to mention that family, as you hear the earliest and most copious
accounts of them. Once more, Adieu!</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS ANNUAL TAX TO THE GOUT.</div>

<p>When I was called upon last February for my annual
tax to the Gout, I only paid for my left foot which in general
is most heavily assessed: the officer came round last week to
collect the small remainder that was due for the right foot. I
have now satisfied his demand; he is retired in good humour, and
I feel myself easy both in mind and body.&mdash;If I complained of
your silence, though somewhat longer than usual, I should be
unreasonable indeed, and I only wish to be assured that it does
not proceed from want of health or spirits. I hope you do not
stand in need of a Physician, but I am concerned to think that,
since the Jew's departure, you have not any one who knows your
constitution or in whom you repose any confidence. How do you
propose to spend the summer? do you mean to breathe the sharp
air of the Welsh mountains? If you would visit the banks of the
Thames you would find a hearty wellcome, and my cottage would
be easily enlarged by an occasional lodging. I feel great comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
in this retreat at Hampton Court, and shall now escape every
week from the heat and dust of the House of Commons.</p>

youngest daughter of Mr. James Porten, a merchant of London. She died
in December, 1747, leaving the maternal care of her son to her sister, Miss
Catherine Porten, the "Aunt Kitty" of the later correspondence, to whom
this letter is addressed. After her father's commercial ruin, Miss Catherine
Porten opened a boarding-house for Westminster School, in College Street.
Under her care Gibbon spent the two years which he passed at Westminster.
He entered the school in January, 1748, and was placed in the second form.</p></div>

Montagu and Lord Southwell, invited a Jew named Abraham Payba to
dine with them at Montagu's lodgings in Paris, in September, 1751. Having
made him drunk, they won from him in less than an hour eight hundred
louis d'or. Their debtor paid them with drafts which he knew would be dishonoured.
Finding themselves outwitted, Taaffe and Montagu broke into
Payba's house, and possessed themselves of a considerable sum of money and
a quantity of jewellery. For this offence they were imprisoned for three
months in the Grand Châtelet (Nichols' <cite>Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth
Century</cite>, vol. iv. pp. 629-634).</p></div>

at King's Cliffe in Northamptonshire. William Law, the author of the <cite>Serious
Call</cite>, originally her brother's tutor at Putney, afterwards her almoner, spiritual
adviser and guide, died at her house in 1761. In the tomb which she
caused to be built for him, she was also herself buried. Hester Gibbon is
stated to have been the Miranda of the <cite>Serious Call</cite>; but her age at the date

unsubstantiated claim to the authorship of <cite>Rule Britannia</cite>, and his edition
of Bolingbroke's works. Bolingbroke, said Dr. Johnson, had "spent his life
in charging a gun against Christianity," and "left half-a-crown to a hungry
Scotchman to draw the trigger." Mallet was "a great declaimer in all the
London coffee-houses against Christianity," and the obtrusion of his sceptical
views made his household unpleasing to David Hume. To his house Gibbon
was taken after his reception into the Church of Rome.</p></div>

militia as respectively captain and major. The South battalion, to which
they belonged, was kept "under arms, in constant pay and duty," from the
date of its enrolment till December 23, 1762, when it was disbanded as a
permanent force. The battalion was at Winchester Camp from June 25 to
October 23, 1761, and from the latter date to February 28, 1762, at "the
populous and disorderly town of Devizes" (see next letter). His <cite>Autobiography</cite>
shows that Gibbon found that "a camp," as Johnson wrote to Mrs.
Thrale in October, 1778, "however familiarly we may speak of it, is one of
the great scenes of human life," and that, partially at least, he agreed with
Lord Chesterfield, that "courts and camps are the only places to learn the
world in."</p></div>

they were only a set of fellows, all whose behaviour was low, and most
of whose characters were despicable. I must, however, except Sir Thomas
and Harrison out of this society. Harrison is a young man of honour, spirit,

a wealthy ice-merchant, opened her <em>salon</em> to philosophers and men of letters.
Madame du Deffand called her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la mère des philosophes</i>, also <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la reine mère de
Pologne</i> for her intimacy with Stanislas Poniatowski. She affected to despise
the influence of Madame Geoffrin. When some friend spoke to her of her
rival's <em>salon</em>, she exclaimed, "Voilà bien du bruit pour une omelette au lard."
Gibbon owed his introduction to Madame Geoffrin to Lady Hervey.
Writing to Lady Hervey in October, 1765, Horace Walpole says of Madame
Geoffrin, "she has one of the best understandings I ever met, and more
knowledge of the world." Yet his account of her, on the whole, confirms
Lord Carlisle's opinion that she was "the most impertinent old brimstone"
(Lord Carlisle to George Selwyn, December 26, 1767). Gibbon speaks in his
<cite>Autobiography</cite> of her "capricious tyranny." In a letter to Gray (January 25,
1766) Walpole paints an elaborate portrait of her and her rival, Madame du
Deffand.</p></div>

a grandson of Sir Hans Sloane. He was a distinguished diplomatist, a
Fellow of the Royal Society, a Trustee of the British Museum, Cofferer of
the Royal Household, and M.P. for Southampton. Walpole speaks of him
as "deep in the secrets of the peace of Paris." He committed suicide at
Althorpe on January 13, 1780. Gibbon knew him through Stanley's connection
with Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Stanley was twice Captain
and Governor of the Island, 1764-66 and 1770-80.</p></div>

Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1761, and in 1762
ambassador to France, where he signed the preliminaries of peace with France

<p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> In Gibbon's Journal at Lausanne, in June, 1757, occurs the entry: "I
saw Mademoiselle Curchod&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnia vincit amor, et nos cedamus amori</i>."
He was, in fact, shortly afterwards engaged to Suzanne Curchod, daughter
and only child of the Minister of Crassy, a hamlet at the foot of the lower
slopes of the Jura, between Geneva and Lausanne. Both the lovers were
born in 1737, and were in their twenty-first year. At Lausanne, at the
<em>Société du Printemps</em> and the <em>Académie de la Poudrière</em>, of which Suzanne
Curchod was the founder and the president, she frequently met Gibbon,
and the attachment, on her side at least, was strong and genuine; on his it
seems to have always had a touch of affectation. The account given by Julie
von Bondeli (E. Bodemann, <cite>Julie von Bondeli</cite>, pp. 217, 218: Hanover, 1874)
of Gibbon's passion has the exaggeration of unreality. He was seen, says
this friend of Wieland and Rousseau, stopping the country people near
Lausanne, and demanding, at the point of a naked dagger, whether a more
adorable creature existed than Suzanne Curchod. Gibbon wrote her several
letters, some of which are quoted by M. d'Haussonville in his <cite>Salon de
Madame Necker</cite>, and addressed to her indifferent verses. The following
lines seem to be an expansion of the entry in his Journal:&mdash;

They became engaged, and Gibbon implored her to marry him without waiting
for the sanction of his father. This, however, she refused to do. When
Gibbon left Lausanne in 1758, she wrote to him once; then all correspondence
between them seems to have ceased, though Gibbon says that he wrote to
her twice on his journey and once on his return to England. He also sent
her his <cite>Essai</cite> with a dedicatory letter in 1761. In August, 1762, he wrote to
break off the engagement, on the ground of his father's opposition, in a
letter quoted by M. d'Haussonville (<cite>Le Salon de Madame Necker</cite>, pp. 57, 58).
In 1763 Gibbon came to Lausanne, and there received from Mademoiselle
Curchod a letter in reply, which showed, so far as words could prove
anything, that she had never ceased to love him. Her friend, the Pastor
Moultou, endeavoured to interest J. J. Rousseau in the story, and to make
him speak to Gibbon on the subject. But Rousseau declined to interfere,
saying that Gibbon was too cold-blooded a young man for his taste or for
Mademoiselle Curchod's happiness. In Gibbon's unpublished diary, he thus
comments on the receipt of this letter, September 22, 1763: "J'ai reçu une
lettre des moins attendûes. C'etoit de Mademoiselle C. Fille dangereux et
artificielle! Elle fait une apologie de sa conduite depuis le premier moment,
qu'elle m'a connû, sa constance pour moi, son mepris pour M. de Montplaisir,
et la fidelité delicate et soutenue qu'elle a cru voir dans la lettre où je lui
annoncois qu'il n'y avoit plus d'espérance. Ses voyages à Lausanne, les
adorateurs qu'elle y a eû, et la complaisance avec laquelle elle les a ecouté
formoient l'article le plus difficile à justifier. Ni d'Eyverdun (dit elle), ni
personne n'ont effacé pendant un instant mon image de son c&oelig;ur. Elle
s'amusoit à Lausanne sans y attacher. Je le veux. Mais ces amusements
la convainquent toujours de la dissimulation la plus odieuse, et, si l'infidelité
est quelquefois une foiblesse, la duplicité est toujours un vice. Cette affaire
singulière dans toutes ses parties m'a été très utile; elle m'a ouvert les yeux
sur le caractère des femmes, et elle me servira longtemps de preservatif
contre les seductions de l'amour." Mademoiselle Curchod came to Lausanne
in February, 1764, and again met Gibbon; "Elle me badine sur mon ton de
petit maître. Elle a du voir cent fois que tout étoit fini sans retour."
"Nous badinons," he says again in the same month, "trés librement sur
nôtre tendresse passée, et je lui fais comprendre tout clairement que je suis
an fait de son inconstance." Gibbon's continued coldness at length convinced
Mademoiselle Curchod that his affection for her was entirely extinguished,
and she took her leave of him in an indignant letter, quoted by M. d'Haussonville,
as she undoubtedly thought, for ever. In this farewell letter she repudiates
the suggestion of her inconstancy: "Si l'on vous a dit que j'aie
écouté un seul moment M. d'Eyverdun, j'ai ses lettres, vous connoissez sa
main, un coup d'&oelig;il suffit pour me justifier." Mademoiselle Curchod married,
at the end of 1764, Jacques Necker, and became the mother of Madame de
Stäel-Holstein.</p></div>

occurs the following entry which explains the words "my friend Wilkes:"&mdash;
"Colonel Wilkes of the Buckinghamshire Militia dined with us, and renewed
the acquaintance Sir Thomas and myself had begun with him at Reading.
I scarce ever met with a better companion; he has inexhaustible spirits,
infinite wit and humour, and a great deal of knowledge: but a thorough
profligate as well in principle as in practice; his character is infamous, his
life stained with every vice, and his conversation full of blasphemy and
bawdy. These morals he glories in, for shame is a <em>weakness</em> he has long
since surmounted. He told us himself that, in this time of public dissension,
he was resolved to make his fortune. Upon this noble principle he has
connected himself with Lord Temple and Mr. Pitt, commenced a public
adversary to Lord Bute whom he abuses weekly in the <cite>North Briton</cite>, and
other political papers in which he is concerned. This proved a very debauched
day; we drank a good deal both after dinner and supper, and when
at last Wilkes was retired, Sir Thomas and some others (of whom I was not
one) broke into his room and made him drink a bottle of claret in bed."
Wilkes had been challenged by Mr. Samuel Martin, M.P. for Camelford,
formerly Secretary of the Treasury under both the Duke of Newcastle and
Lord Bute, for speaking of him in the <cite>North Briton</cite> as a low fellow and dirty
tool of power. Wilkes was dangerously wounded in the duel, which was
fought in November, 1763. In the preceding April he had been arrested
under a General Warrant on suspicion of being the author of No. 45 of the
<cite>North Briton</cite>. He applied for a writ of Habeas Corpus, and the case came
before Lord Chief Justice Pratt in the Court of Common Pleas. He was
discharged from custody, the judges unanimously holding that the arrest
was a breach of his privilege as a member of Parliament.</p></div>

d'honneur avec un c&oelig;ur des mieux placé." The friendship then begun
ripened into warm affection. "My obligations to the long and active
friendship of Lord Sheffield," Gibbon says in the will by which he appoints
his friend one of his executors, "I could never sufficiently repay." Of the
warmth of his affection, and the nature of some of his obligations, the letters

at the latter's house at Lausanne. Deyverdun died in July, 1789, leaving
his house and land by will to Gibbon for his life.</p></div>

in his Journal for November, 1762. [<cite>Memoirs of My Life and Writings&mdash;Miscellaneous
Works</cite>, vol. i. p. 154 (second edition, 1814).] By the "School
of Vice" it is more than probable Gibbon meant White's Club, formed in
1736, at this time the great Tory gaming club. It contained within its
walls an Old and a Young Club, the Old being recruited from among the
members of the Young. Hence, perhaps, arose its name of the "School of

in the Colonies, received the royal assent March 22, 1765, and came into
operation November 1, 1765. When Parliament reassembled on January 14,
1766, Pitt attacked the policy of the Act. General Conway, one of the
Secretaries of State, who replied to him, said that the sentiments which he
had expressed were substantially those of the ministers, and that, for his
own part, he would gladly resign his office if Pitt would take it. Grenville,
who followed, defended the Act, and it was in reply to him, on the same
evening, that Pitt delivered one of the most eloquent and famous of his
speeches. Ireland took a keen interest in the question, and the debate
happens to be fully reported by two Irish gentlemen, Sir Robert Dean and
Lord Charlemont; otherwise, like many others of the time, it might have
passed without record. In the same session, February 24 to March 17, two
resolutions were carried in both Houses, one declaring the right of Great
Britain to tax the Colonies, the other repealing the Stamp Act. Two Acts
of Parliament expressed these resolutions in legislative form.</p></div>

against the Castle interest and that of the Holmes family. In 1586, when
the Crown sought to create a parliamentary party in the House of Commons,
six members were returned to Parliament by the three boroughs of Newport,
Newtown, and Yarmouth, because in the Isle of Wight, through its military
captain and governor, the influence of the Crown was paramount. Gradually
the leading families of the island acquired control over the three boroughs,
and at this period they were disputed by the Worsley, Barrington, and
Holmes families, the latter being descended from Sir Robert Holmes, who
took New York from the Dutch, and "first bewitched our eyes with Guinea
gold." At the election of 1768 the following members were elected for the
respective boroughs:&mdash;Newport: Hans Sloane, Esq., and John Eames, Esq.,
one of the Masters in Chancery. Newtown: Sir J. Barrington, Bart., and
Harcourt Powell, Esq. (re-elected). Yarmouth: Jervoise Clarke, Esq., and

is said to be derived from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductus</i>, and to mean "music reduced
to a full score." It came to mean an entertainment of music and dancing,
and was used as a synonym for masquerades. Bramston, in <cite>The Man of

things which in plain English would have seemed objectionable&mdash;

<div class="line">"In Lent, if masquerades displease the town,</div>
<div class="line">Call 'em ridottos, and they still go down."</div>

<p>
The word survived in the <em>Redoutensaal</em> of Vienna and the <em>Redoutentänze</em> of
famous composers. Other authorities derive the use of the word from the
sense in which it is employed by Dante, <em>i.e.</em> a "shelter," or "place of refuge."
Hence it came to mean a "place of convivial meeting." In Udino's Italian-French-German
Dictionary (Frankfurt, 1674) the German equivalent is
given as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Spielhaus</i>. The transition from this to "ball-room" is not difficult.

born in July, 1751. She married in October, 1766, Christian VII., King of
Denmark. Before her departure from England, her portrait was painted
by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who complained that she was so constantly in
tears that he could do justice neither to her nor to himself. The marriage
proved unhappy. Her husband appears to have been a low brute, whose
excesses impaired whatever mind he originally possessed. The queen, on
her side, was guilty, at the least, of imprudences which were used against
her by her enemies. During his travels, the king had made a favourite
of a young physician named Struensee, who practically became Prime
Minister, and, with his friend Brandt, governed Denmark. The Queen
Dowager, Juliana Maria, stepmother of the king, placed herself, with her
son Frederick, at the head of the malcontents. In January, 1772, Struensee
and Brandt were arrested, and, after a protracted inquiry, executed in the
following April. The queen was imprisoned at the Castle of Cronenbourg.
From this prison she was released by the intervention of her brother,
George III., and passed the few remaining years of her life at Zell, in
Hanover, where her great-grandmother, Sophia Dorothea, had died in
captivity. There she died in 1775, at the age of twenty-four.</p></div>

in Oxford Road at the expense of sixty thousand pounds." "Imagine
Balbec in all its glory!" he writes, when it was approaching completion
in April, 1771. The Pantheon, built by Wyatt, was opened on January 27,
1772, "to a crowded company of between fifteen hundred and two thousand
people. In point of consequence, the company were an olio of all sorts;
peers, peeresses, honourables, and right honourables, jew brokers, demireps,
lottery insurers, and quack doctors" (<cite>Annual Register</cite>). It was destroyed
by fire on January 16, 1792.
</p>
<p>
Gentlemen and ladies could only subscribe to the Pantheon on the
recommendation of a peeress, in order to prevent, as the proprietors announce
in the <cite>Gazetteer</cite> (December 17, 1771), "such persons only from obtaining
subscriptions whose appearance might not only be improper but subversive
of that elegance and propriety which they wish on every occasion to preserve."
On the other hand, once admitted to be subscribers, they could
introduce friends of any or no character. The struggle between the two
factions was decided by the efforts of a number of gentlemen, headed by
Mr. William Hanger, who, with drawn swords, succeeded in forcing an
entrance for Mrs. Baddeley. Possibly Gibbon meant, instead of repeating
"Gentlemen Proprietors," to mark the contrast by writing "Gentlemen
Subscribers" in the second sentence. The dispute is alluded to in a poem
published in 1772, called <cite>The Pantheon Rupture; or, A Dispute between
Elegance and Reason</cite>. In their dialogue Elegance says&mdash;

financial embarrassments of the East India Company, had for many months
attracted public attention. In April, 1772, a Select Committee of the House
of Commons was appointed to investigate the Company's affairs. During
the recess (June 10 to November 26) the directors applied to Lord North for
a loan of £1,500,000. On November 26 Parliament met, being specially
summoned to discuss the state of India, and Lord North proposed and carried
a motion for a Secret Committee of Inquiry. Four months later (March 9,
1773), Lord North proposed to lend to the Company £1,400,000, on condition
that its dividends were restricted, and its surplus revenues appropriated to
the liquidation of the debt. On these conditions, the Company was to enjoy
possession of the territorial acquisitions till 1779, when its exclusive charter
expired.
</p>
<p>
On May 3, the General Court of Proprietors of East India Stock petitioned
Parliament against arbitrary interference with their territorial rights. The
petition was ordered to lie on the table, and Lord North introduced the
outlines of his scheme for the reconstitution of the Company. The chief
changes were the appointment by the Crown of a governor-general and the
establishment at Calcutta of a Supreme Court of Judicature. These changes
and the provisions for the loans were embodied in two Bills, which received
the royal assent on June 21 and July 1 respectively (13 Geo. III. cc. 63 &amp; 64).
</p>
<p>
On May 10, whilst Lord North's proposals were under discussion, General
Burgoyne moved three resolutions: (1) That all acquisitions made by
military force or by treaty with foreign powers do of right belong to the
State; (2) that to appropriate such acquisitions to private use is illegal; (3)
that such acquisitions have been appropriated by private persons.
</p>
<p>
The first two resolutions, which virtually transferred to the Crown the
territorial acquisitions made by the Company in India, were carried that
night without a division. The third, which was practically an indictment
of Lord Clive, was rejected on May 21.
</p>
<p>
John Burgoyne (1722-1792) married Lady Charlotte Stanley in 1743, and
through Lord Derby's influence was now M.P. for Preston. He was made a
major-general in 1772. His motion on the East India Company was his
chief political achievement, his surrender at Saratoga (October 17, 1777)
the most striking episode in his military career, and his comedy, <cite>The Heiress</cite>

Spain famous for its manufactory of gloves and stockings. The magistrates
of the place thought they could not better express their joy for the reception
of their new queen, than by presenting her with a sample of those commodities
for which alone their town was remarkable. The <em>major domo</em>, who
conducted the princess, received the gloves very graciously; but, when the
stockings were presented, he flung them away with great indignation, and
severely reprimanded the magistrates for this egregious piece of indecency.
<em>Know</em>, says he, <em>that a queen of Spain has no legs</em>. The young queen, who at that
time understood the language but imperfectly, and had often been frightened
with stories of Spanish jealousy, imagined that they were to cut off her legs.
Upon which she fell a-crying, and begged them to conduct her back to
Germany, for that she could never endure the operation; and it was with
some difficulty they could appease her" (Hume's <cite>Philosophical Works</cite>, ed.

Indiaman, in May, 1773, in order to take up an appointment in the Company's
service at Bombay. On the voyage he quarrelled with Lieutenant James
Ferguson, whom he killed at the Cape in September, 1773. It was alleged
that Roche had treacherously assassinated his antagonist; but, on his trial
at Cape Town, it was proved that Ferguson was the assailant, and that Roche
had killed him in self-defence. Strong feeling was aroused about the affair,
because Roche was wrongly identified with a notorious duellist of the day.
The governor of the Cape obtained a passage for Roche in a French frigate
to Mauritius, whence he reached Bombay. On arrival there, he was arrested
and sent home to England. Examined before the Privy Council on July 10,
1775, he was committed to Newgate. A special commission was issued
(August 5) to try him, and at the Old Bailey, on December 11, 1775, he was
again acquitted of the charge of murder. (See <cite>A Plain and Circumstantial

</p>
<p>
"On the day I first sat down with Johnson, in his rusty brown, and his
black worsteads, Gibbon was placed opposite to me in a suit of flower'd
velvet, with a bag and sword." The "costume," he adds in a note, "was not
extraordinary at this time, (a little overcharged, perhaps, if his <em>person</em> be
considered,) when almost every gentleman came to dinner in full dress."
"Each," he continues, "had his measured phraseology; and Johnson's famous
parallel, between Dryden and Pope, might be loosely parodied, in reference
to himself and Gibbon. Johnson's style was grand, and Gibbon's elegant;
the stateliness of the former was sometimes pedantick, and the polish of
the latter was occasionally finical. Johnson march'd to kettle-drums and
trumpets; Gibbon moved to flutes and hautboys; Johnson hew'd passages
through the Alps, while Gibbon levell'd walks through parks and gardens.
Maul'd as I had been by Johnson, Gibbon pour'd balm upon my bruises, by
condescending, once or twice, in the course of the evening, to talk with me;
the great historian was light and playful, suiting his matter to the capacity
of the boy;&mdash;but it was done <em>more suá</em> (sic); still his mannerism prevail'd;&mdash;still
he tapp'd his snuff-box,&mdash;still he smirk'd, and smiled; and rounded his
periods with the same air of good-breeding, as if he were conversing with
men.&mdash;His mouth, mellifluous as Plato's, was a round hole, nearly in the

<cite>William and Margaret</cite>, nor does the writer on Marvell, in the same series,
lay any claim for Marvell to its authorship. Thomas, better known as
"Hesiod," Cooke, who published his <cite>Life and Writings of Andrew Marvell</cite>

Jacques de la Lande, Marquis du Deffand. Separated from her husband in
1722 for her relations with the Regent duc d'Orléans, the President Hénault,
and others, she lived chiefly at Sceaux till the death of her husband in 1750.
In 1753 she opened her salon at the Convent of St. Joseph. A year later
she became totally blind. She had stayed at La Source with Lord Bolingbroke
in 1721, and since then had known some of the most distinguished
men and women in France and England. But the following extracts from
her correspondence with Walpole, who had introduced Gibbon to her, show
her appreciation of the historian as a member of society:&mdash;"Je suis fort
contente de M. Gibbon; depuis huit jours qu'il est arrivé, je l'ai vu presque
tous les jours; il a la conversation facile, parle très-bien français; j'espère
qu'il me sera de grande ressource" (May 18, 1777). "Je lui crois beaucoup
d'esprit, sa conversation est facile, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et forte de choses</i>, comme disait Fontenelle;
il me plaît beaucoup, d'autant plus qu'il ne m'embarrasse pas" (May 27).
"Je m'accommode de plus en plus de M. Gibbon; c'est véritablement un
homme d'esprit; tous les tons lui sont faciles, il est aussi Français ici que
MM. de Choiseul, de Beauvau, etc. Je me flatte qu'il est content de moi;
nous soupons presque tous les jours ensemble, le plus souvent chez moi; ce
soir ce sera chez Madame de Mirepoix" (June 8). "M. Gibbon me convient
parfaitement; je voudrais bien qu'il restât toujours ici; je le vois presque
tous les jours; sa conversation est très facile, on est à son aise avec lui"
(June 22). "M. Gibbon a ici le plus grand succès, on se l'arrache; Je ne sais
pas si tous les jugements qu'il porte sont bien justes, mais il se comporte
avec tout le monde d'une manière qui ne donne point de prise aux
ridicules; ce qui est fort difficile à éviter dans les sociétés qu'il fréquente"
(September 21).</p></div>

knew English well, and translated into French several of the <cite>Portraits</cite> of
Lord Chesterfield. Her conquest of the Duke of Richmond was well known
in Paris. Gibbon himself was her victim. "Le Gibbon," writes Madame
du Deffand to Walpole, April 20, 1780, "était aussi un peu épris; elle fait
plus de conquêtes à présent qu'elle n'en a fait dans sa première jeunesse;
sa coquetterie est sèche, froide et piquante; c'est un nouveau genre qu'a sa
séduction." The Vicomtesse de Cambis died at Richmond in 1808. Madame
de Genlis, who disliked her, says (<cite>Mémoires</cite>, vol. ii. pp. 30, 31) that she was
deeply pitted with the small-pox, and that "elle avoit l'air le plus dédaigneux
et le plus impertinent qu'on ait jamais osé porter dans le monde."</p></div>

"wicked imp they call a poet." "My old friend Miss Speed," writes Gray
to Wharton in 1761, "has done a very foolish thing; she has married the
Baron de la Perrière, son to the Sardinian Minister, the Count de Viry. He
is about twenty-eight years old (ten years younger than herself), but looks
nearer forty." In September, 1777, Viry was recalled from Paris, and
disgraced, because, as was alleged, his wife had been bribed by Lord
Stormont to betray the diplomatic secrets of the court of Turin. Another
account is given in Lescure's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Correspondence Secrète sur Louis XVI., Marie
Antoinette, etc.</i>: "M. le Comte de Viry, ambassadeur de Sardaigne, est
rappelé à Turin. On croit qu'il y a de la disgrace" (vol. i. p. 74). A secret
treaty was signed early in 1777 between Austria, France, Spain, and
Sardinia against England, and the secretary of the Comte de Viry "a
vendu une copie du traité à milord Stormont" (<em>ibid.</em>, vol. i. p. 82). See also,

is printed a letter from Gibbon to Garrick, written from the "Hôtel de
Modène, rue Jacob, Fauxbourg St. Germain," at Paris, and dated August
14th, 1777. Gibbon begins by thanking Garrick for a kindly mention of
his name. "It is pleasant to find one's-self mentioned with friendship by
those whom posterity will mention with admiration. Foreign nations are
a kind of posterity, and among them you already reap the full reward of
your fame." "You have reason," he continues, "to envy me, for I can truly
declare that I reckon the three months which I have now passed in Paris
among the most agreeable of my life. My connection with a house, before
which the proudest of the Gallic nobles bow the knee, my familiar acquaintance
with the language, and a natural propensity to be pleased with the
people and their manners, have introduced me into very good company; and,
different in that respect from the traveller Twiss, I have sometimes been
invited to the same houses a second time. If besides these advantages your
partiality should ascribe any others to your friend, I am not proud enough
entirely to disclaim them. I propose to stay at Paris about two months
longer, to hook in (if possible) a little of the Fontainebleau voyage, and to
return to England a few days before the meeting of Parliament, where I
suppose we shall have some warm scenes. You cannot surely be satisfied
with the beginning, or rather no beginning, of the American campaign,
which seems to elevate the enemies as much as it must humble the friends
of Great Britain.

"At this time of year, the society of the Turk's-head" (in Gerrard Street,
where the Literary Club met) "can no longer be addressed as a corporate
body, and most of the individual members are probably dispersed; Adam
Smith in Scotland; Burke in the shades of Beaconsfield; Fox, the Lord or
the devil knows where, &amp;c., &amp;c. Be so good as to salute in my name those
friends who may fall in your way. Assure Sir Joshua, in particular, that
I have not lost my relish for <em>manly</em> conversation and the society of the brown
table. I hope Colman has made a successful campaign. May I beg to be
remembered to Mrs. Garrick? By this time she has probably discovered the
philosopher's stone; she has long possessed a much more valuable secret,&mdash;that
of gaining the hearts of all who have the happiness of knowing her.

At the close of 1778 a number of petitions were presented from Dutch
merchants to their High Mightinesses the States-General of the United
Provinces, protesting against the right of search for contraband of war which
was exercised by the British ships. In September, 1780, an American packet
was captured, on board of which was Mr. Laurens, President of the Congress.
A box of letters, which he threw overboard, floated, and was found to contain
a draft treaty between the United States and Holland, and various letters
from the "patriotic party," showing that Amsterdam at least wished for
alliance as early as August, 1778. A memorial reciting these letters was
delivered to the States-General in November, 1780, but no answer was
returned. In December the British ambassador was recalled, and the Dutch
ambassador left London, December 30, 1780.</p></div>

over the battle of Ushant. The English fleet under Keppel had met the
French fleet under Count d'Orvilliers off Ushant on July 27, 1778. An
indecisive engagement was fought. Keppel signalled to Sir Hugh Palliser
to come up and renew the battle next morning; but Sir Hugh, whose own
ship had suffered severely, was unable to do so. The French retired on the
29th to Brest, and Keppel to Portsmouth. Palliser made charges against
Keppel, which led to a court-martial on the latter. The charges against
him were pronounced to be malicious and ill founded, and his conduct was
declared to have been that of a brave and experienced officer. Similar
charges were made by the Comte d'Orvilliers against the Duc de Chartres,
who commanded the Blue Squadron of the French fleet, and did not obey
the signal of his superior officer.</p></div>

Hampshire, and many other counties petitioned the House of Commons to
grant no more taxes till the expenses of Government were reduced and
sinecure places abolished. The tone of several of these county meetings
seemed almost to threaten Civil War. Devonshire is said to have voted a
fund for buying arms. The Yorkshire petition was presented by Sir George
Saville, February 8, 1780.</p></div>

independence of Parliament, and for Economical Reform, in a speech which
Lord North said was "such as no other member could have made." Besides
other reductions of expense, he proposed to abolish altogether the Board of
Trade, the Civil Branch of the Ordnance, and the third Secretaryship of
State. Lord North allowed the Establishment Bill to be brought in, the
only member who opposed its introduction being Lord George Gordon. The
House of Commons went into Committee on the Bill, March 8, 1780.</p></div>

religious researches." As an Academy of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Belles Lettres</i> he held the commissioners

The Northumberland Militia, which reached London on June 7 by a forced

protect, if possible, Mr. Langdale's distillery. By Thursday morning the
tumult was entirely suppressed. "To Colonel Holroyd, since deservedly raised

before the House, the sheriffs of Coventry were committed to Newgate, and
a new election ordered. The poll began towards the end of November, and
remained open for thirty days. At the close, though a large majority voted
for Colonel Holroyd and Mr. Yeo, Sir Thomas Hallifax and Mr. Thomas
Rogers were declared duly elected. The unsuccessful candidates petitioned
against the return. The first day on which a committee could be balloted
for was June 26, 1781. But on the motion of Lord Beauchamp (January
23) the petition of Lord Sheffield and Mr. Yeo was referred to a committee
for February 15. The return was amended by an order of the House, dated
February 27, 1781, by substituting for Hallifax and Rogers the names of
Colonel Holroyd (who in the interval had been created Lord Sheffield) and

to the Duke of Gloucester. When the second volume appeared, it was, in
like manner, presented to the Duke, who "received the author with much
good nature and affability, saying to him, as he laid the quarto on the table,
'Another d&mdash;mn'd thick, square book! Always scribble, scribble, scribble!
Eh! Mr. Gibbon?'" (Best's <cite>Personal and Literary Memorials</cite>, p. 68).
"You will be diverted to hear," writes Walpole to Mason, January 27, 1781,
"that Mr. Gibbon has quarrelled with me. He lent me his second volume
in the middle of November. I returned it with a most civil panegyric. He
came for more incense; I gave it, but alas! with too much sincerity; I
added, 'Mr. Gibbon, I am sorry <em>you</em> should have pitched on so disgusting a
subject as the Constantinopolitan History. There is so much of the Arians
and Eunomians, and semi-Pelagians; and there is such a strange contrast
between Roman and Gothic manners, and so little harmony between a Consul
Sabinus and a Ricimer, Duke of the Palace, that though you have written
the story as well as it could be written, I fear few will have patience to read
it.' He coloured: all his round features squeezed themselves into sharp
angles; he screwed up his button-mouth, and rapping his snuff-box, said, 'It
had never been put together before'&mdash;so well, he meant to add&mdash;but gulped
it. He meant <em>so well</em> certainly, for Tillemont, whom he quotes in every page,
has done the very thing. I well knew his vanity, even about his ridiculous
face and person, but thought he had too much sense to avow it so palpably."</p></div>
